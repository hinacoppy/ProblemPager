 <div class="description">Outside in the gardens of Harbinger Hall the autumn colours were truly magnificent and a carpet of leaves lay on the ground. The players in the library may have taken notice of nature’s beauty but in truth, they were more focused on the board in front of them.<br>
<br>
In the box sat the excitable Quentin Quickcube.  “Well, my friends, you have chosen a very bad time to fan. I won’t play on for the gammon but if each of you would kindly pay me two points we can move on to the next game.” So saying, he pushed the four cubes set on 4 across the board.<br>
<br>
Cautious Cuthbert was first to speak. “Well, you can have two points from me, QQ. Much better than paying you eight in a few minutes time.<br>
<br>
Barry Bigplay now entered the conversation. “As you know there is nothing I like better than a big play but I think that even I will have to go quietly on this particular occasion. I can’t see how we can win this one.”<br>
<br>
“Graves, a little more tea if you please,” Said the Dowager Duchess. “I hate dropping, particularly against QQ, but things do look bleak. As usual I will follow your lead, EE. What say you?”<br>
<br>
The Enigmatic Englishman had remained silent while all this was going on but now he too, entered the debate. “I think you are all drinking from half-empty glasses. What bunch of pessimists. Let’s look at the positives: we have a 21-pip lead in the race and we have a five-point home board to QQ’s two point board. <br>
<br>
“Admittedly only a 55 from QQ leaves us a direct shot next turn but he cannot execute a normal blitz, precisely because of our five-point home board. If we manage to hit a shot it will very likely be a winning hit. Because QQ will have to exercise caution quite often we will get anchor somewhere in QQ’s board and then win from there.<br>
<br>
“We will win a fair percentage of gammons but I wager we will the game 30% of the time. That makes this a comfortable take and so, I accept your redouble, QQ.”<br>
<br>
“Exactly as I thought,” said DD. “Obviously I take as well.”<br>
