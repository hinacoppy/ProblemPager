 <div class="description">Thanks to those who commented on this position (and all the others)  and also for reaffirming the unwritten rule that your comments should be your own and not that of a bot.<br>
<br>
This comes from the British Masters tournament this weekend. Red was Mochy ad White was Peter Bennet. After long thought Mochy doubled and Peter took. Mochy rolled 62, one of his three immediate shot leaving numbers (62, 52 and 65). Peter redoubled, hit the shot, closed Mochy out and won game and match.<br>
<br>
As pointed out in the comments technically this is just a double and a trivial take and between two equal players those are the correct actions. BUT as World #1 Mochy is risking a lot here in what is basically a no skill position. Just the sort of situation he should be avoiding.<br>
<br>
I agree with Paul Lamford that Mochy should have held the cube here, waited for some improvement and then doubled White out. If, as in the actual game, he is hit and closed out then he will still be leading 9-8.<br>
