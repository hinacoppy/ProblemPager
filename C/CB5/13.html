 <div class="description">As I often said before match play is much more difficult than money play because of the need to take into account the match score when making doubling decisions and checker plays.<br>
<br>
I see three very common types of errors in match play: cashing a single point when playing on for the gammon is correct; overplaying the position when trailing, remember first when the game and then win the gammon; making money play decisions in match situations.<br>
<br>
The last of these three is by far the most common. Firstly, let’s take a simple example. Your opponent holds a 2-cube and is trailing 0-2 in a match to 5. You reach a position where both players have four checkers on each of their 1- and 2-pts. Your opponent redoubles to 4 – what do you do? <br>
<br>
For money this is an easy and well known take. At this match score taking would be a quadruple blunder because you need 33% game-winning chances to take. Having a simple understanding of match equity would enable you to make the right decision but time and again I see players taking such redoubles because they haven't dome their basic homework.<br>
<br>
This week’s positions has Black to play a 52 at double match point (DMP). At DMP there are no gammons and the cube is out of use. You must win by moving the checkers to give you the best possible chance of winning the game.<br>
<br>
Black failed the test in his match. He made the (correct) money play of 10/8, 6/1 but failed to ask himself the fundamental question: “How am I am going to win from here?”. Leaving three checkers stuck behind White’s broken prime with very little time to escape them is certainly not the right plan. <br>
<br>
Red must play boldly and step up to White’s 4-pt with 23/21. The five should then be played 10/5 and not 8/3 which puts a checker out of play unnecessarily. The play is risky – it loses 5% more gammons than 10/8, 6/1 but crucially it wins 2.5% more games which is the only thing that matters.<br>
It is sometimes difficult to get out of the money game mindset, especially if you play a lot of chouettes, but to be successful in tournaments you have to learn to make that vital adjustment and focus on what is important and that is nearly always the match score. You have been warned!<br>
