 <div class="description">At the end of a long session Black was losing concentration. He was hoping for any five or eight or even a lucky 63. He would have accepted a small double but was deeply disappointed to see this 43 tumble out of the cup.<br>
<br>
Uttering a weary sigh, he swiftly moved 9/6, 9/5 and picked up his dice – it just wasn’t going to be his day. White’s double six compounded his problems and he had drop White’s double on his next turn.<br>
<br>
The problem with backgammon is that sadly you cannot afford to let your attention wander or let fatigue take hold of you, although backgammon players are famous for very long sessions and many have seen the dawn rise more than once.<br>
<br>
Given this as a quiz problem I would expect the majority of players to find the correct move. It is clear that Black cannot allow White his full roll – he is threatening to escape his last rear checker and/or make his bar point. Black must take a tempo from White and the only way he can do that is to hit and therefore the three must played 4/1* and after that the obvious four is 9/5. White cannot double from the bar as if he fans he will be in severe gammon danger. <br>
<br>
If White does hit he will probably win but he stays on the bar nearly forty-five percent of the time and then Black has very real winning chances. <br>
<br>
Once you see the play it becomes obvious, at least to the modern expert. The problem is actually seeing 9/5, 4/1* as a candidate play. We are taught to keep our five-point primes intact and most of the time that is the correct thinking but the key is to see when breaking the prime is more advantageous than keeping it.<br>
<br>
This sort of hit, known as a banana split play, was laughed at before the bots came along but they are not hidebound by ‘traditional’ thinking. They merely apply logic to any given situation and so they have no difficulty at all in finding plays such as 9/5, 4/1*. <br>
Modern players are using the tactic more and more but opportunities are often missed in live play. That was the case here where Black never even considered the banana split play. In 1844 George Frederick pardon wrote: “Backgammon has always been a fire-side, a domestic, a conjugal game; it is not so abstruse as to banish conversation on general topics; it does not like chess, or love, or art, or science, require the entire man.”<br>
<br>
I beg to differ, top-class backgammon requires deeps concentration and fine attention to detail.<br>
