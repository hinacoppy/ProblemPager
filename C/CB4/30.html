<br>
Firstly this is not too good to redouble. Two small numbers from Red and an entering number from White and Red would be sweating. Once the home board goes, as here, your opponent gets more counter-chances than you would think.<br>
<br>
For money or if your opponent was leading this would be very clear drop because White loses too many gammons. My initial guess was 30% gammon losses and that turns out to be slightly under the mark. That would mean needing to win nearly 40% of games to take and White is nowhere near that. Similarly if this was an initial double from the centre then it would be a massive pass.<br>
<br>
BUT once the cube gets high in a short match strange things happen. Here White gets huge leverage because of his potential redouble to 8. Were he to win an 8 game he would lead 8-1 which means he would have reached the Crawford game and Red would be on an odd number which is an ideal scenario for White (of course if he wins a gammon with the cube on 8 he wins the match) and note that once the cube reaches 8 Red's gammons are valueless as 8 points win the match for him. This peculiar set of circumstances gives White just enough equity to take the redouble - but it's still no bargain. Note that if white was the stronger player he should probably drop anyway. Whoever said backgammon was easy!<br>
