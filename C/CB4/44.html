 <div class="description">On initial evaluation XG has this as double/pass but a log rollout gives very clear double but also a very clear take.<br>
<br>
From Red's perspective the position is volatile and making his 4-pt and /or possibly the bar-pt would certainly lose his market. He also has a long-term advantage because White's 1-2 back game is not well timed.<br>
<br>
From White's point of view he has the guarantee of 1-2 back game, albeit poorly timed, but he may be able to make Red's 4-pt or bar-pt or even, very rarely, win by going forwards from here. His real weakness is his structure. If he had his 5-pt instead of his 3-pt the position would be no double/take but the fact that he has made a deep in-board point, coupled with the poor distribution of his spare checkers, gives him a weakness that Red should rightly exploit by doubling.<br>
