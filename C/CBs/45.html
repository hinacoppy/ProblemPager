 <div class="description">In Kenny Roger’s famous song “The Gambler” he repeats the line “know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em” which is the basic strategy for poker. The same strategy, in a slightly different way, also applies to backgammon.<br>
<br>
There are times when you have to recognise that you are in a losing position and that the best course of action is to limit those losses. This normally involves just losing a single game rather than a gammon or a backgammon.<br>
<br>
In this week’s position Black elected to play 23/22, 6/4(2)*, 3/2. On a freak day White might enter immediately and then roll a couple of big doubles to crack his prime and let Black win by going forward. However, in the real world it is Black whose board will disintegrate and then he may end up with more checkers sent back , no chances to win the game and a gammon loss a high probability.<br>
<br>
At the moment he has only four checkers behind White’s prime which gives him very real chances of saving the gammon if he can avoid more checkers being sent back. The best play is 23/22, 6/5(3), largely giving up on winning but only losing a gammon 22% of the time. With the move actually chosen he increases his gammon losses to around 33% while actually decreasing his winning chances (from 7% to 6%).<br>
<br>
It always hard to wave the white flag, particularly in a game famous for its last-minute turnarounds, but Black must do precisely that in this position.<br>
<br>
Now let’s suppose this position occurred at Double Match Point. In this scenario the cube is irrelevant and gammons do not count. Black can now employ a very different strategy as his only concern is winning the game. The best play to achieve that aim is 6/4*, 3/1, with the objective of obtaining a playable back game. With this move Black’s winning chances rise to 10%. His 43% gammon losses are, luckily, of no consequence.<br>
<br>
So remember to follow the wise words of The Gambler: “know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ’em.”<br>
