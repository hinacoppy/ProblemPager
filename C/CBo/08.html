We are so used to having the doubling cube in play and making checker play decisions based upon the cube position that we sometimes find it hard to adapt our thinking when the cube is not in play at all.<br>
<br>
The most obvious example of this is at Double Match Point (DMP) when not only is the cube not in play but gammons and backgammons do not count either. Given that DMP is the most critical score that you can have in a match it is surprising just how many mistakes are made at this score.<br>
<br>
As a reminder one of the things we seek to do at DMP is to make sure that we keep all the checkers in play. Dead checkers are normally ruinous at DMP because, as you cannot win with the cube, it is crucial to have one’s whole army at one’s disposal.<br>
<br>
I was guilty of very muddy thinking in this week’s position at DMP. As Black I had 65 to play and spent a long time considering whether to play 14/3, creating a five-point prime, but one that may not live very long, or the more aggressive 8/3, 8/2*, following the principle of attacking a lone rear checker.<br>
<br>
In the end, I chose the hitting play and won quite easily as my next several rolls all had a five in them. Feeling pleased with myself I followed my usual practice of analysing the match with XG. To my chagrin I discovered that my move was a blunder and even 14/3 was an error.<br>
<br>
The best move was one that I hadn’t even considered: 23/12! Once you see the play its benefits are clear. Primarily it ensures that Black maintains his timing and all his checkers remain in play. In addition, it provides outer board coverage if White escapes his rear checker.  Note also that if White hits Black’s blot on his 3-pt, whilst not ideal, it may help to preserve Black’s timing if he stays on the bar for a roll or two. <br>
<br>
I think that 23/12 is difficult to see because it plays to the abnormal conditions defined by DMP and I did not have my thinking correctly tuned for that circumstance. If this position occurred in a money game it is likely that Black would own the cube. In that case 14/3 would very clearly be the correct move because it significantly reduces the number of gammons lost. 8/3, 8/2* would then be a double blunder because of the gammons.<br>
<br>
So in summary make sure that at DMP you have the right mind-set as the game begins and try to keep all your checkers in play because that gives you more flexibility and hopefully, more routes, to victory.<br>
