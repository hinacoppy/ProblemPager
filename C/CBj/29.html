Along with the rest of the backgammon world I was deeply saddened at the weekend to hear of the death of Martin Birkhan at the very young age of 47. I got to know Martin when he played in some of the London Open tournaments. He was a true gentlemen and an excellent player. We also did some commentary togther at one of the tournaments and after an interesting incident i wrote a couple of articles. In tribute  to Martin the first of those articles is posted today. See if you can solve the problem - the second article with the solution will be published tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Fabio Gullotta for winning the London Open Professionals Tournament for the second year in succession. He came from 2-9 down in a match to 13 to beat Raj Jansari. Raj had a great weekend because he won the London Open title and with it a superb Geoffrey Parker board. The whole tournament was a huge success and my congratulations to all involved in running it so well, especially Sean Williams, Zoe Cunningham and Mike Main.<br>
<br>
I was commentating with Martin Birkhan of Germany on an earlier match between Julian Fetterlein (Red) and Nick Check (White) when this position arose with the score 5-3 to 11 in Nick’s favour. Julian redoubled to 4. The problem was Nick couldn’t remember doubling to 2! Neither Martin nor I could remember the initial double either. The tournament director, Mike Main, asked for the video to be replayed and we discovered that the doubling cube hadn’t be centred after the previous game.<br>
<br>
The cube was then set to 1 in the centre, Julian doubled and Nick passed. The incident demonstrated excellent use of video technology (Sepp Blatter please note) but had it not been available it would have been interesting to see what the ruling would have been. I am still researching backgammon laws to see if there is a precedent.<br>
<br>
Was Julian’s double to 2 correct? Should Nick have passed or taken? If the cube had been on 2 on Julian’s side of the board what would the correct cube actions have been?<br>
