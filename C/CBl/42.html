 <div class="description">Long-term backgammon colleague and top player, Raj Jansari, posted this position on Facebook. The position actually occurred in a match situation but the correct play is the same in a money game so we will look at that scenario.<br>
<br>
Step back in time before the advent of neural net computer programs (bots) and in a chouette there would have been a brief discussion about the relative merits of 13/11, 8/7 and 18/16, 8/7. In fact, the two plays have identical equities and so the discussion would have been largely a waste of time.<br>
<br>
In the late 1990s, once the bots demonstrated their credibility, players began to take note of their more unusual plays and adopt them. I had seen several positions of this type before Raj posted this one and was reasonably certain that making the 5-pt with 7/5, 6/5 was the correct play.  I had recently re-read Hickey and Storer’s “What’s Your Game Plan?” and recalled that one of their problems (No. 43) is very similar to Raj’s. Is the risk of leaving fourteen shots justified in order to make the Golden Point (as Paul Magriel named the 5-pt)? <br>
<br>
Owning an asset is much more powerful than threatening to own an asset. Strategically the 5-pt significantly improves Black’s position. Prior to the move his checkers are not that well placed and having both the 8-pt and the 2-pt is very inefficient. Ideally those checkers on the 8-pt should be used to make home board points. The first step is to strengthen the home board by making the 5-pt. In an ideal world, perhaps Black would prime White’s rear checkers but more likely White will run off his rear anchor and then a blitz may well become the preferred game plan. Owning the 5-pt is a huge step forward in support of that plan.<br>
<br>
Tactically, owning the 5-pt constrains White’s and rolls such as 41, 43, 44 and 45 now play very badly for him. One key tactical question is what happens if White hits the Black blot on the bar-point? Black will be favourite to enter but even if he fans Black will have an easy take of White’s redouble although it might look frightening. In fact, after the sequence: Black 21: 7/5, 6/5 White 63: 24/18*/15 Black 66: fans, technically White is not good enough to redouble although many players would do so.<br>
<br>
Backgammon players are still not that good at balancing risk and reward and they have a habit of being overly pessimistic. In this position White’s hits after 7/5, 6/5 are certainly annoying but on the other twenty-two rolls Black will be very happy that he made the 5-pt. Bots are much better at judging risk and reward because they have the processing power to be able to do so and are not influenced by emotions.<br>
<br>
Once you have studied any position a key learning tool is to adjust things slightly to see what difference that can make. For this position I gave White his 4-pt by moving the spare checkers from his 6- and 5-pts. Now you would think that one of the ‘safer’ plays would be correct. Not according to our silicon friend! XG rollouts have 7/5, 6/5 as the best play, ahead of 18/16, 8/7 by 0.02 equity points.<br>
<br>
I think I would have trouble getting chouette partners to agree to that play (!) but it is actually a brilliant example that truly demonstrates the understanding – or lack of it - of risk and reward. Most humans would fail the test.<br>
