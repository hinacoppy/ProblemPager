“Confound it, Jeeves,” I remarked, as I returned home from another late-night session at The Drones. “Yet again, I have had to swell Oofy Prosser’s already considerably swollen bank account.” For those who don’t know him Oofy is the club millionaire and has the stuff in sackfuls.<br>
<br>
“The man just does not know how to lose and manages to escape from completely lost positions time and again. Would you like to see an example?”<br>
<br>
“That would be most gratifying, sir,” replied London’s premier manservant.<br>
<br>
I rapidly set up the board as shown above. “I had this simple 52 to play and quickly chose bar/20, 12/10, making the golden point and minimising shots, the logical play I think you will agree. Oofy rolled 21 which he played 24/23, 17/15*. I stayed on the bar by rolling double 1 and as usual Bertram went on to lose a gammon. I think you can agree, Jeeves, that I was deucedly unlucky?”<br>
<br>
“I would like to agree with you, sir, but sadly I think we must add this position to the list that you have entitled Bertram’s Bloomers.”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord, Jeeves. How so?” I enquired.<br>
<br>
“Firstly, if you enter on the 20-pt with the 5 then the 2 should be played 7/5, taking the sting out of White’s rolls of 21 and 11. A small but crucial detail that I think you must have overlooked. However, the bigger mistake was to enter on the 20-pt at all. The correct play with your 52 is bar/23, 20/15.”<br>
<br>
“I have to say I did not even consider that move, surely making the golden point is clear and obvious?”<br>
<br>
“Ordinarily it is something to be desired but there are exceptions to every rule and this position is one of them.”<br>
<br>
“Kindly explain why, my good man”.<br>
<br>
“Certainly, sir. You are behind in the race, which is an indicator that the 23-pt would be a better point than the 20-pt to hold. White has very little spare time and if you leave a blot on White’s 2-pt it can be attacked when White rolls large numbers. It is much better for Black if those large numbers have to be played awkwardly, which may well be the case if you hold the 2-pt anchor. The other key factor is that you want spare checkers in the outer boards to attack White’s blot(s) and to possibly complete a full prime by making your 8-pt.”<br>
<br>
“You must eat an awful lot of fish, Jeeves, to power that great brain of yours and to be able to generate all these ideas. I must admit, this analysis has both astonished and educated me.”<br>
<br>
“My pleasure, sir. I will just add this position to the list.”<br>
<br>
“And then please bring me a large whisky and soda to provide me with some solace.” <br>
<br>
Note: My thanks to Edward Onny for showing me this position.<br>
