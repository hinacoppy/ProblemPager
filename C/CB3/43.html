 <div class="description">This position was originally posted by Bill Davies. It is Double Match Point and Black has double ones to play.<br>
<br>
One thing that is in short supply in the modern world is patience. We live in a society where the desire for instant gratification is the norm rather than the exception. The modern child, in the main, does not understand the concept of quietly waiting for something rather than insisting upon having it now. <br>
<br>
In backgammon, there are times when, to quote an old adage, “patience is a virtue’. Here Black may decide that he must come to the edge of White’s prime and play bar/22 and then either choose 3/2 or 5/4* with his final ace. The latter is an attempt to win by brute force, hoping that White does not hit from the bar and then that he can swiftly roll an escaping six. <br>
<br>
The problem is that if White rolls any of his fifteen hitting numbers from the bar Black will be virtually dead. Not only that but he may not be able to cover the blot or lift it next turn even if it is not hit this time.<br>
<br>
If he chooses 3/2 then that is a very passive move, giving White multiple game plan options. He will hit with his threes and cover the outfield if he cannot hit immediately.<br>
<br>
The patient approach is not to come to the edge of the prime at all. Black should play bar/24, 6/5(3)* or bar/24. 5/4(2)*, 3/2. This gives him a stronger home board than White and hopefully some time to escape his rear checker. In some variations his four-point prime will come in very useful. On average Black will take five and a half rolls to escape that rear checker so he is a long way from becoming favourite but the important thing is that bar/24, 6/5(3)* gives him his best winning chances. That move will win nearly 26% of the time.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you have to accept the fact that you cannot win the game by brute force but have to hope that patience will win the day. While Black has only one rear checker there will still be hope for him. The hot-headed youth may well play bar/22, 5/4* but the wiser, older player will quickly see the merits of bar/24, 5/4(3)*.<br>
<br>
Patience is indeed a virtue.<br>
