<div class="description"><hr>
This position demonstrates just how deceptive backgammon can be. It occurred in the Battersea chouette and the team (Red) all doubled. The box thought for a long time before taking but did so – several of the team seemed surprised at the take and one went so far as to say he thought it was a clear drop. The game continued and Red went on to win a single game. <br>
<br>
Now what about the double and take? White cannot be blitzed due to his anchor. The position is more likely to become a prime vs. prime than anything else. Red has an advantage because of his shot at the White blot but if he misses he won't have much of an edge. White has all his checkers in play and has both priming and blitzing potential.<br>
<br>
Notice also that Red's sixes are duplicated – if he rolls 61, 62 or 63 he should hit and not make the 5-pt although it's close. All of this adds up to the fact that this position is not even a double and in fact it is nearly a blunder to do so! Obviously the take is trivial. A surprising result I think you'll agree.<br>
