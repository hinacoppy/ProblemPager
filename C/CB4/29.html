 <div class="description">Most of the problems that I post on my website in my “Position of the Day” can be solved by both experts and strong intermediates. That doesn’t mean an expert will get them all correct or even get 80% of them right first time but they are set at a level to both instruct and entertain a wide range of backgammon players.<br>
<br>
The same is not true of The Othello Quiz. Not all of Japan’s strong players play outside Japan and Ichikawa Masanori, also know as Othello, is one such player. Each year at the Japanese Open he publishes his quiz which consists of ten checker-play positions he has encountered in his previous year’s play. The entrants to the tournament are invited to take part in the quiz. It is universally recognised as the most difficult backgammon quiz in the world.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge nobody has ever scored ten out of ten and most years the winner scores around five out of ten, although one year it did reach eight. This demonstrates just how difficult backgammon can be and how much we still have to learn about the game, especially when you consider that doubling cube problems are not even included.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is my favourite from the 2017 Quiz – how should Black play 31? <br>
<br>
I think a lot of players would try bar/24*, 8/5*. Other options include bar/24*/21 (my own choice) and bar/22, 6/5*. Very few players would find the correct play of bar/22/21!<br>
<br>
Once you consider the move its advantages become clear: it doesn’t recirculate White’s dead checker on his ace-point so White is effectively playing with fourteen checkers; it starts a second anchor in White’s home board; by not hitting Black maintains good timing for a possible back-game; if White does not escape his rear checker then Black can still attempt to win by going forward and attacking White’s rear checker.<br>
<br>
The double hit is too aggressive given that Black has four rear checkers, the better home board and a four-point prime. Hitting on the 5-pt with bar/22, 6/5* leaves Black with four checkers stacked on White’s 3-pt – not a good structure.<br>
<br>
I would wager that not more than one in fifty players would find bar/22/21 over the board and not more than one in ten would solve it correctly in a quiz.<br>
