Black studied this 42 for quite some time. He was agonising over whether to choose 24/20, 10/8 or 24/22, 10/6. In doing so he was trying to preserve his 43-pip lead while at the same time preparing to escape his lone rear checker. <br>
<br>
This all looks very logical but in fact his thinking was flawed. By advancing his rear checker he invites White to attack it which is precisely what he wants to do especially if Black elects to play 24/20, 10/8. Secondly, he will have twelve of his checkers on three points and although they are reasonably well placed to make a home-board point next turn there is gross inefficiency in their current placement. Finally, Black’s chances of safely running that rear checker all the way home without interference from White are slim indeed. <br>
<br>
Black never even considered the correct move in this position which is to simply make his 4-pt with 8/4, 6/4. He may have noticed that he could make his 4-pt but was quickly put off the idea because it left a double shot, apparently for no reason.<br>
<br>
He needed to look deeper. 8/4, 6/4 puts two of Black’s checkers exactly where he wants them and creates a broken four-point prime.   White will in all likelihood hit with a 1, 35 or 26, but if he hits with a 4 he will have to give up Black’s 5-pt to do so (unless he rolls 44). That will give Black counter-attacking chances on his 5-pt. Meanwhile his rear checker can remain on White’s ace-point. For the moment it is in no danger and ideally Black wants to further strengthen his home board before he makes a run for it. Remember, it is rarely right to partially advance a single rear checker as your opponent will immediately attack it.<br>
<br>
Once you play 8/4, 6/4 its strengths become obvious. The problem is in making sure that it is a candidate play in the first place. One of the most common mistakes in backgammon Is to try to choose between two moves, A and B without ever realising that Move C is even a viable candidate.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is a classic demonstration of that principle. It also shows that you cannot play backgammon by just making moves, your need to have a plan that meets the demands of the position. Black failed to think things through and just ended up choosing a move, 24/20, 10/8 that was, in XG terms, a bad error.<br>
