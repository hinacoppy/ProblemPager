<div class="description"><hr>
Black was delighted to roll a 1 and be able to play bar/24, securing an anchor and keeping him in the game until the end. Gaining the anchor would also save him a fair few gammons. Keeping in his mind that he wanted to save the gammon he played 13/10 with the 3.<br>
<br>
This move leaves White only eight hitting numbers (all 7s plus 53) and, if not hit, Black had the potential to build a prime in front of White’s rear checkers. The problem was that once he had anchored Black’s priority should have changed. <br>
<br>
The question he should have asked himself was this: “how am I going to win this game?”. Once he asks that question then the answer then dictates the game plan. The answer is that Black must get White to break his full prime. How can he achieve that? The answer to that second question is that he must limit White’s choices on his next and subsequent rolls.<br>
<br>
After bar/24, 13/10, four numbers crack White’s prime, 11,33 and 64. After bar/24, 6/3* Black leaves White 15 immediate hitting numbers and the same number of cracking numbers (four), 22, 33 and 24 but there are subtle differences.<br>
<br>
Firstly, Black starts building his own prime more quickly when he hits on the 3-pt and is not hit back. Secondly, if White enters on the 2-pt (or fans) then on the following roll he will have many more cracking numbers. One of the advantages in backgammon of hitting an opponent’s blot is that (barring doubles) 50% of his next roll will be taken up in entering from the bar and his choice of entry point may well be forced. <br>
<br>
This position is one where you want to limit your opponent’s choices as much as possible and so bar/24, 6/3* is the correct move. The play wins 4% more games than bar/24, 13/10 and loses only 4% more gammons so in terms of equity that is a very good deal. Not hitting is an error but not a blunder.<br>
<br>
The general principle of proscribing your opponent’s moves is an important one in backgammon, and it can often be used to make the correct decision over the board. The more you play the game the more the oldest backgammon adage of all. ‘when in doubt, hit’, is proved to be correct.<br>
