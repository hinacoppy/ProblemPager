 <div class="description">Emmanuel Lasker was the World Chess Champion for 27 years, from 1894 to 1921. That was a remarkable achievement given how many strong players there were at the time. Obviously, Lasker was a very strong and natural chess player, but one thing set him apart from his contemporaries.<br>
<br>
Lasker made a detailed study of his opponents and would then steer for lines of play that made those opponents uncomfortable. He would frustrate great tacticians by choosing quiet variations where the advantage is accumulated very slowly, but against passive players he would employ sharp lines that created tactical opportunities.  This methodology kept him at the top of the chess world far longer than many expected.<br>
<br>
The same methods can be used in backgammon, although here the dice obviously have an influence. If you are the stronger player a series of mutual holding-point games are not what you want, as they are relatively simple to play. You need to playing prime versus prime and back games with the odd complex blitz thrown in Conversely a weaker player will want those mutual holding-point games and straightforward races.<br>
<br>
It is perhaps in the area of doubling that the stronger player can reap the most benefit. In games between two strong players you can expect relatively logical and sensible cube handling and I would not try to too many bluffs but when faced with a weaker player there are many opportunities to steal a point.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is a case in point. It is taken from the Barnes chouette where White was a relatively weak visitor to the game and I was captain of a three-man team playing Black. Our visitor had already demonstrated a propensity to drop gammonish doubles. When this position was reached one of my teammates swiftly doubled. <br>
<br>
I was certain this was technically no double, but I also thought that if we put enough pressure on White he might just drop. Therefore, I doubled while the third player held his cube. Lo and behold, the box duly feared losing a gammon and promptly dropped the two cubes – the pressure had done its work.<br>
<br>
The game continued with the remaining team member rolling 44 (played 8/4, 7/3(3)*. The box responded with 52 (bar/23, 6/1*) and when Black fanned the box could claim a point. That third team member was left to rue not doubling with his two colleagues. Doubling was an error but not a blunder but dropping the double was a septuple blunder! <br>
<br>
The Lasker method had once again been employed with success, but not without risk. However, the risk paid off and the reward was duly earned. This article merely touches the surface of this method, so we will return to it again. Meanwhile, remember that whatever XG thinks, most of the time your backgammon will be played against error-prone human beings and you need to understand them just as well, if not better, than the pure mechanics of the game.<br>
