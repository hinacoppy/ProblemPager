 <div class="description">This position occurred this week when I was running a training session for relative beginners. All of the class gave virtually no thought to doubling this position as Black, but I stopped them rolling so we could do some analysis. Long experience of broken primes over the last few years has taught me just how powerful they can be. <br>
<br>
My students did not have the benefit of having a huge number of similar reference positions to call upon, but I did. Remember that most doubling decisions are made by reference to one’s store of backgammon knowledge.  Of course, we add calculation on top of the initial subjective analysis to arrive at a decision, but you cannot play top-class backgammon without having a personal library of thousands of reference positions.<br>
<br>
A beginner looking at this position sees only White’s five-and-a-half-point home board and does no further analysis.<br>
<br>
An expert sees more. Firstly, any 2 by Black is nearly always a winning roll. However, if Black fans, White needs to a number of things to win the game. He needs to cover the blot on his 2-pt, he then needs to escape two checkers from behind a broken prime. To do that he will need to roll two 2’s and then two 5’s or 6’s.<br>
<br>
That is a lot to ask while all the time Black is threatening to roll a two and probably win the game. When you need to do a number of things to win a game the percentage chance of doing so is the product of the chances of the individual events occurring. <br>
<br>
If things do go well for White, he will win some gammons and that must be taken into consideration as well. The position is highly volatile so if it is a double Black should be doubling now and not after he rolls the winning 2.<br>
<br>
My opinion was that this was indeed a correct double for Black. My students were somewhat surprised by this but agreed to double. Black went on to win a gammon. In fact, Black wins this position two-thirds of the time and about a quarter of those wins are gammons. White wins the rest of the games and a third of his wins are also gammons. <br>
<br>
A long rollout shows that the double is correct, and it is an error not to double now. The take is, of course, very easy. I would not expect many players to drop as White, but you never know in backgammon. The key point is to be able to recognise that Black has a double in the initial position and to be able to do that you need a reasonable amount of experience. That is why both playing experience and hours of study are necessary to become an expert at the game.<br>
