 <div class="description">Two thousand five hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote the classic book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Entitled “The Art of War”, the book has been used by all levels of the military ever since. Its teachings have been adapted for use in politics, business and everyday life. <br>
<br>
Its teachings are also to applicable to representations of war and never forget that backgammon is precisely that. The two armies of fifteen soldiers manoeuvre on a small battleground and strive for ascendancy. <br>
<br>
Two fundamental pieces of teaching from Sun Tzu are these: never let your army be split into groups that cannot communicate with each other; soldiers that are away from the field of battle cannot usefully contribute to that battle. In extremis this latter point can be extended to the well-known backgammon aphorism, “dead men tell no tales”.<br>
<br>
This week’s position comes from this year’s World Championship. White was Akiko Yazawa, the 2014 World Champion, but the focus here is on Black. He has doubled and has a strong position. He would like to have thrown a three but 51 popped out of the cup. How should he play it?<br>
<br>
He certainly had not read Sun Tzu’s book as he woodenly moved 10/5, 7/6. This play is safe, but it does not meet the demands of the position. After 10/5, 7/6 Black has 12 checkers in his home board that will not be moving for some time to come. While the home board acts as a deterrent those twelve checkers are effectively frozen in time and nearly all of his moves will have to be made with his three rear checkers.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Black’s army is split in two and it is White who controls the outer boards. Because of this many of Black’s may become forced and the wrong double at the wrong time could crunch his home board.<br>
<br>
Now look at the strength of 24/18. This keeps the bar point slotted and if there is an exchange of hits on the bar or elsewhere then Black’s strong home board may well come into play. Even 20/15, 7/6 was much better than the move played.  The end result was that White took control of the game and ended up winning the game with a well-timed redouble.<br>
<br>
“The Art of War” has stood the test of time for the very good reason that its teachings are as relevant today as when they were first written. You may not want to read the whole book but if you browse the Internet for some of its more famous quotes I am convinced they will improve your game.<br>
