 <div class="description">One of the key questions that you have to ask yourself when doubling is this: by doubling now are you giving away something that could be used more effectively later? Once you have doubled your opponent you must win the game with your checker play alone, as the cube is no longer available to you. If you decide not to double then you still have the threat of using the cube later, perhaps giving your opponent a much more difficult decision. I call this concept ‘Cube Future Value’ (CFV).<br>
<br>
Let’s look at this week’s position from the final of the RAC 32 tournament this week. Black, Peter Bennet, is trailing your columnist (White) 1-3 in a match to 5. For money this is nowhere near a double, White has too much work still to do, but the perceived wisdom at 4-away vs. 2-away is that one should double very aggressively, especially if there is any hint of a gammon in the air. Knowing this Peter doubled and naturally I accepted.<br>
<br>
He then rolled one of his worst numbers, 42 and had to hit with 11/5*. I responded with 65 (luckily not 55!). I moved bar/20*/14* and the game and match were both soon over. Let us go back to the double. If Black rolls any 2 or 4 then he cannot point on White and White will have a lot of play as evidenced by the game continuation. But what if Black does point on White and White enters, which he is favourite to do?<br>
<br>
Let us give Black a 61, played 11/5*, 6/5 and assume White enters with a 23, played bar/23, 11/8. What about this position? Black now has some very strong threats and although White has a take it is a much more uncomfortable one than in the in the original position. What if Black makes the 5-pt and White fans? Then the position is double and drop but only if Black still has access to the cube. If Black has already doubled, giving up his CFV then, of course, the game will continue, and White will win the game and the match nearly 20% of the time.<br>
<br>
In the modern game players are much quicker to double than they were twenty or thirty years ago and, in the main, an aggressive strategy is likely to the correct one. However, you still need to give your opponent a difficult rather than a trivial decision. CFV is a very powerful concept and one that should be applied in many more situations than it is.<br>
<br>
In the original position, because the gammon threat is small and because of CFV, Black does much better to hold on to the cube and in fact, by a small margin, XG rates doubling as a blunder.<br>
