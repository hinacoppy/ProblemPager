<div class="description"><hr>
I had this position against Rachel Rhodes in the Scope tournament last weekend. <br>
<br>
For money this is nowhere near a double and it would be a big blunder to do so. At this score however Red can double much earlier than usual with a gammon threat – which Red certainly has here – and White will hardly ever be able to redouble so the cube is virtually dead after Red's double. <br>
<br>
According to the rollouts the double is correct by 0.004 so basically either doubling or not doubling is correct – the key is to at least consider doubling. <br>
<br>
I did double, rolled an innocuous 65 and some time later lost the race – in fact Rachel was able to redouble me out when she established a huge lead.<br>
<br>
I won the Crawford Game but lost the next one and thus the match with it. I fared better in the Consolation which I won beating Tariq Saddiqi 9-8 in a close-fought final.<br>
<br>
The Masters was won by Eric McAlpine (he also won it two years ago!) beating Sean Williams in the final.<br>
