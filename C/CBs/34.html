<div class="description"><hr>
The summer had been unusually warm, and the criminals of London had apparently taken a holiday. As a result, Holmes and I had played more backgammon than was usual during the summer months.<br>
<br>
Sadly, my results against Holmes in training matches, and also in the Diogenes Club weekly tournaments had not really improved.<br>
<br>
After we had enjoyed one of Mrs. Hudson’s fine dinners I decided to tackle the subject head-on. “Holmes, can you identify any particular reasons for my recent poor performances over the board? I find it very frustrating that no matter how much I play my results do not seem to improve.”<br>
<br>
“I think, Watson,” replied the great detective, ”that you are guilty of one of the most common errors of all and that is that you are still making money-based doubling decisions when you are involved in match play. I cannot stress too highly just how important the match score is when handling the cube in match play. Time and again I see good players forgetting to give enough thought to that all-important match score.”<br>
<br>
“Can you give me an example?”<br>
<br>
“Certainly, my dear doctor. Do you remember this position from your match against Lestrade at the Diogenes earlier this week?”, said Holmes as he quickly set up the position you see above. “The score was 0-0 to 5 and Lestrade (White) offered you a redouble to four which you accepted.”<br>
<br>
“I certainly do, “I replied. “I was very pleased to try out those new racing formulae that you taught me a couple of weeks ago. My mental arithmetic is not the quickest as you know but after a couple of minutes I was confident that I had got my sums right and that this was a comfortable take for Black.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, it is an easy take for money, but you did not look deeply enough into the position. Once you have calculated the correct action for money you must then apply that information to the match score. You must always beware of letting your opponent get to the Crawford Game or win the match with perfect efficiency.<br>
“Here, Lestrade was able to offer you a perfect redouble and if he won the game (which of course he did) then the score would be 4-0 (Crawford) to him. Unlike a money game, you do get full use from owning the cube on 4 because if you redouble to 8 you only get to use one of the three extra points. The correct match play decision was to pass the redouble and play from 0-2 behind.”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord, Holmes”, I replied. “I certainly did not think that decision through in the manner you have described.’<br>
<br>
“And that, my dear Watson, is the nub of the problem. You must learn to think in that manner if you are ever to become a strong match player.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Holmes, that was a most enlightening conversation.”<br>
