 <div class="description">The key to a successful back game is, of course, not to play one in the first place. There is too much that can go wrong and when you lose the game you often lose a gammon. Having said that, sometimes you are forced into a back game or it can be the best game plan available to you.<br>
<br>
The best back game points have been argued over for ages, but the 1-3 and 2-3 games are generally accepted as the best ones to play. The 1-2 game is potentially the best of all, but it is extremely difficult to time a 1-2 game as the bear-in of the other player is so slow, as first his sixes and then his fives cannot be played while all the time the back game player’s home board is at risk of crunching.<br>
<br>
The general rule of thumb is that you should trail in the race by at least the number of pips equal to the two back game points that you hold. So, for a 1-2 game you need to trail by 94 pips (48+46). For the 3-4 game you need to trail by 86 pips (44+42).<br>
<br>
In this week’s position Black trails by 65 pips after the roll (unless he hits a White blot). He could try to to win the game by going forward with something like bar/23, 9/8(2)*. However, consider the following factors: Black has only seven checkers in the attack zone; his army is split in two because he has lost his mid-point; White has no real weaknesses other than the blots on his 17-pt and 12-pt, and the rest of his game is fundamentally sound.<br>
<br>
An optimist might try to win by going forward but a pragmatist will steer for a 3-4 back game with bar/22, 23/22. White cannot prime him because Black holds White’s bar-point. He will be able to use that escape point to recirculate checkers and hopefully he will be able to force White to hit one ore more of his blots as they are recirculated.<br>
<br>
The 65 pips that he trails by now should grow and easily reach the target of 86 pips (or more). Thus, Black will end up with a very well-timed 3-4 back game. Any play other than bar/22, 23/22 is a blunder. Bar/23, 9/8(2)* is a double blunder because the hit delays White. it would be disastrous if Black was to play bar/23, 9/8(2)* and then White was to roll doubles sixes.<br>
<br>
It is tempting to try to win by going forward but it is just not the right game plan. This is a position that cries out for Black to play a back game and so that is what he should do. It takes discipline to steer for a back game but when it is the most logical game plan then you must follow the logic.<br>
