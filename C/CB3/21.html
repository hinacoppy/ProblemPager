 <div class="description">A few years ago, I helped Dale Kerr with his research into the World Backgammon Championship and I have always maintained a keen interest in the topic.\<br>
<br>
Each year I do a 30-minute presentation on a backgammon-related topic at our club Christmas party and last year I chose the World Championship. In doing the necessary research I came across this Gammon Press article: <br>
<br>
https://thegammonpress.com/world-backgammon-championship-1/. <br>
<br>
Presumably this was authored by Bill Robertie.<br>
<br>
This is an excellent piece of work and clears up two of the long-standing mysteries surrounding the World Championship (WC): Alice Topping did not win the WC in 1970. There was no WC tournament that year; the 1976-78 Monte Carlo tournaments were not World Championships but European Championships.<br>
<br>
I have since gone through my collection of old backgammon magazines and can certainly confirm the second point. It has been said the 1976-78 European Championship tournaments at Monte Carlo were World Championships in principle but is clear that thyey were exactly as advertised - European Championships.<br>
<br>
Given this, it is interesting that the current 2017 WC at Monte Carlo is advertised as the 42nd World Championship. That number is undeniably wrong. For the correct number you can take your pick from the following:<br>
<br>
1) It is the 42nd consecutive backgammon tournament at Monte Carlo<br>
2) It is the 39th World Championship at Monte Carlo.<br>
3) It is the 49th World Championship.<br>
<br>
I have a strong preference for the third option on the grounds that I am more interested in the tournament than the venue. That means that the 2018 tournament will be the 50th World Championship - something to celebrate! I hope the organisers get the numbering sorted out before next year’s significant anniversary.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile this year’s tournament is under way and sadly the British contingent has not fared well – in fact there has never been a British winner of the tournament. This year the streaming has been better and should you wish to do so you can watch the final on Sunday at: https://www.twitch.tv/usbgfbroadcast<br>
<br>
The only qualification for playing in the tournament is having the necessary self-belief and, of course, more than a thousand euros to spend. The quality of the play is not of the same standard as the Nordic Open and I have been disappointed in the standard of play in the early rounds. <br>
<br>
Players constantly make cube decisions too quickly and do not take sufficient account of the match score. Having written an article on three-move opening sequences earlier this year I have also been studying how many errors are made in those first three moves and sadly I must report a constant stream of errors.<br>
<br>
In this week’s position Black has opened with 32 and White has responded with 31, making his 5-pt. How should Black now play 54? A world-renowned player managed to find 13/9, 11/6, which is the third best play in the position and a significant error. I would have expected a top player to have ‘known’ the correct play is 21/16, 13/9, but his play proved once again just how many errors are made in the very early stages of the game.<br>
