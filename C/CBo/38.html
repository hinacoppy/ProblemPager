 <div class="description">On Christmas Day Holmes and I dined with Mycroft in the Stranger’s Room at the Diogenes Club, it being the only room in the club where talking is permitted! The club may contain the most misanthropic men in London but their catering staff are magnificent and by the time we took to the comfortable chairs to enjoy a glass of port we were well sated.<br>
<br>
As ever the conversation drifted towards backgammon and we ended up discussing whether or not it was a more complex game than chess.<br>
<br>
“The two games cannot be compared directly,’ said Holmes. “They require slightly different skills although pattern recognition is a fundamental part of both games. In chess, one can see further ahead because the number of possible moves at any one turn is very small. In backgammon the dice introduce an element of uncertainty and many more possible moves.”<br>
<br>
“That is true,’ agreed Mycroft. “A chess player can play to a specific plan for a long time while a backgammon player may have to change his game plan several times during a single game due to the vagaries of the dice. A backgammon player also has to be adept at mental arithmetic because at the highest levels of the game mathematics plays an important part in the decision-making process. A chess player must be adept at foreseeing possible different patterns and evaluating those patterns using his personal database of ‘known’ positions. The calculations of a chess player involve the ability to accurately see whether a particular combination of moves will lead to him gaining the advantage.”<br>
<br>
“Fascinating,” I replied. “I suppose both games have moves that are more or less forced and require very little thought. Some of the opening sequences in chess can be played without much thought as both players know them several moves deep. In backgammon also, sometimes a play is very obvious and can be played quickly and without too much study. For example, if Black rolls a double two in this position (see diagram), then he can quickly play 13/5 and pick up his dice.<br>
<br>
“Capital, Watson! You have demonstrated precisely the point I was about to make,” said Holmes. “In both games, you can seldom play on automatic because the pattern might not be exactly as you remember it and there may be factors that you have not considered.”<br>
<br>
“But surely, Holmes, you do not disagree with my 13/5 play in this position?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, he does,” said Mycroft, re-entering the conversation. “While making the 5-pt normally has a high priority, in this particular position Black has a more pressing need and that is escaping his rear checkers. He will be forty-two pips ahead after the roll and his rear checker are in danger of becoming stranded. This double two is just what he needs to get those checkers moving. You will find, my dear Watson, that 20/16(2) is the correct move. White is not favourite to hit the blot left on the 5-pt and if it is hit Black should have no trouble recirculating it.”<br>
<br>
“Good Heavens,” I exclaimed. “I never considered your play. It would appear that you see things more deeply than I do.”<br>
<br>
“Possibly, but perhaps Sherlock and I are merely better at applying the knowledge that we already have? One thing is certain and that is that neither backgammon nor chess can be played without thinking. Both games constantly throw up new challenges and learning opportunities. That is why they have both lasted for many centuries and will survive for many centuries to come. Now, perhaps one more glass of port?”<br>
