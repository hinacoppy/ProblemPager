 <div class="description">When doubling was first introduced to the game in the late 1920s its impact on match play was hardly understood at all. Indeed, I believe that it took backgammon players a very long time to really understand doubling at all, never mind its influence on match play. The basic 25% take point for accepting a double was not explained in any backgammon publication before 1970!<br>
<br>
Back in 1930 Georges Mabardi, a leading player and author of the era, had got as far as postulating: “If two absolutely perfect players engaged in a match, there would never be an accepted double.” Imagine playing a 25-point match against Georges - it would have been a very long and dull affair.<br>
<br>
Even in the 1970s handling the cube in match play was fairly rudimentary and if you look at Goulding’s “Backgammon with the Champions” or Roberties’s “Lee Genud vs Joe Dwek” you will see just how far off some of the doubling decisions were. Until the advent of the bots cube handing in general and in match play in particular was still weak. <br>
<br>
The last twenty years have seen a huge improvement in cube handling by all levels of players because our analysis is just so much more accurate and, because of the increases in computer processing power, the bots can do thousands of rollouts while we sleep, so what would once have taken days now takes minutes.<br>
<br>
One of the key lessons that the bots has taught us is just how aggressive we can be when trailing in a match and the shorter the match the more aggressive we can be. This week’s position arose in a match with Black trailing 0-2 to 7. He had been playing a well-timed 2-4 back game when he suddenly found himself on the offensive after hitting two White blots.<br>
<br>
For money this would be a slightly premature double. Black still has a lot of work to do and if thing go wrong then he could easily lose a gammon. At this match score not doubling would be a triple blunder! It would be criminal for Black to roll 62, for example, and lose his market. Losing your market when trailing in a position where gammons abound for both players is not to be countenanced.<br>
<br>
Note that White’s redoubles to 4 will be severely constrained because Black will be able to take with relatively low winning chances and his subsequent redouble to 8 would put the match on the line. This means that White’s redoubles to 4 will happen much later than in a money game.<br>
<br>
It is this understanding of the influence of the match score on both cube handing and checker play that has developed so much in recent years. Today’s strong intermediate player would trounce most of the ‘experts’ of forty years ago. <br>
<br>
I have no doubt that over the next ten years as processing speeds continue to increase and the bots become ever stronger that our match play skills will be developed even further.<br>
