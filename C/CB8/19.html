 <div class="description">If the sequence goes redouble/take how should Red play 63?<br>
<br>
This is Wayne Felton vs Mochy from the British Masters. <br>
<br>
Firstly for money this is a huge redouble and a mega-drop – too many gammons.<br>
<br>
At the match score it is also clearly a double but surprisingly it also a very clear take because of the strength of White’s redoubles and also because Red doesn’t get full value from his gammons as it gets him to 12 points. It’s perhaps hard to believe that a quadruple blunder can become a take because of these small differences but that is the case here.<br>
<br>
Technically 14/5 is better than 14/8*/5 because if you crunch the win/gammon percentages through a MWC table Red ends up with 2% more Match Winning Chances by not hitting, as White’s board often crunches before he gets a shot.<br>
<br>
Now let’s go back to the real world.<br>
<br>
Wayne redoubled and time stood still as Mochy thought for six minutes before taking. Wayne rolled 63, played 14/8*/5 and won gammon and match.<br>
<br>
Should Mochy have taken? This is largely a non-skilled position – it plays itself. Should Mochy risk the loss of the match in such a position? I think it depends on what he thinks the ELO difference is between himself and Wayne. He must have decided the difference wasn’t enough to pass.<br>
<br>
What about Wayne’s 63? Without the Quiz Factor nobody would pass up the hit here and Wayne said he didn’t even consider not hitting. Given that there is an ELO difference between the two players I think he was absolutely correct to hit.<br>
<br>
Such an apparently simple position but look how much analysis it has generated  - tricky game backgammon!<br>
