 <div class="description">Fear can do terrible things to players in match play, particularly towards the end of a match when one error can cost the whole match. This week’s position is a classic example of how fear can affect even the best players.<br>
<br>
Black led 6-4 to 7, post-Crawford. He has just rolled 54 and must decide how to play it. Unfortunately, he failed the test dramatically by choosing the ‘obvious’ 7/2, 6/2. This does make a fourth home board point but leaves Black stripped on all his outfield points. His (erroneous) thinking was that if he did not have to leave any shots so why should he do so. He didn’t want to expose multiple blots because of the fear (that word again) of losing a gammon.<br>
<br>
The game continued with White making his 5-pt with a 31 and then Black got into difficulty clearing those outer board points, left a shot, got hit and went on to lose a gammon and the match.<br>
<br>
Fear had got to Black in a very bad way indeed. Had he looked logically instead of emotionally at the position, he would have reasoned as follows:<br>
<br>
After the roll I will be 49 pips ahead, that indicates a running play; White has a completely undeveloped board but all his checkers are in play so now is the time to take a small risk; if White hits I want him to have to give up his rear anchor to do so as I have the stronger home board in any hitting battle; I don’t really want to safety the checker on my bar-point as I would like to make that point and on the bar-pt it is also a builder for my 5-pt, another point I want to make.<br>
<br>
Thinking like this Black would quickly have spotted 15/11, 15/10. At a stroke he has cleared the most difficult of his outer board points and brought builders to bear on the points he really wants to make. Only 44, 22 and 43 hit two Black blots so surely the risk must be worth the reward.<br>
<br>
Looked at in the cold light of day the correct move is very clear, but the problem is that over-the-board play exerts pressures not evident in that clear light of day. Given this as a quiz problem most strong players would get it right. The question is what percentage of them would make the correct play under the pressure of a match situation?  My estimate would be no more than 60%.<br>
<br>
In technical terms 7/2, 6/2 is a blunder, costing Black 4% in game-winning chances. Yes, 15/11, 15/10 does lose more gammons but not nearly enough to compensate for the error in moving 7/2, 6/2.<br>
