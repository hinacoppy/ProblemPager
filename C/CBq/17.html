<div class="description"><hr>
Last weekend the RAC once again very successfully hosted the annual charity tournament in aid of Scope. Scope (www.scope.org.uk) does tremendous work for disabled people and their families. I do not have the final figure for the amount raised on the day, but it was many thousands of pounds.<br>
<br>
I have played in the tournament many times but, other than winning the Consolation one year, without success. This year, I am pleased to say, there was a different outcome and after seven and a half hours of virtually non-stop play I emerged with the first prize which is a superb Geoffrey Parker backgammon board where I can specify my own colours. <br>
<br>
In the early rounds I beat Lewis Potter, Antonio Sgambato and Sean Williams. In the semi-final I managed to overcome Peter Bennet (some positions from that match in due course) and then I had to face Eric McAlpine in the final. Eric is a two-time winner of Scope and I was determined not let him win for a third time.<br>
<br>
Things did not look too good when I lost a gammon to go 6-9 behind in a match to 11. However, I managed to win the next couple of games with well-timed doubles and so we reached 8-9. If you have read last week’s article you will know that the correct tactic at 3-Away versus 2-Away is to double early as the trailer and to drop early as the leader, particularly when there is a gammon threat.<br>
<br>
I have spent countless hours on GridGammon learning exactly when to double at this particular match score precisely because it occurs so frequently. After a couple of moves we reached the position above. For money this would be a premature double but at this score I can never be redoubled and there is a meaningful gammon threat. I could lose my market by next turn and so this is precisely the correct moment to double. In fact, not doubling is a clear blunder.<br>
<br>
I doubled (there were a few gasps in the crowd) and Eric took which is perfectly correct. I rolled 61 and moved 13/7, 6/5*. Unfortunately for him, Eric chose this moment to dance with a 63. Two turns later I rolled 44 and had three of Eric’s checkers on the bar against my four-point home board.<br>
<br>
He did manage to anchor on my 2-pt and for a while he looked like saving the gammon, but at the key moment I manged to roll a couple of doubles and won a gammon and the match.<br>
<br>
Without all those hours of practice online I may well not have doubled at the right moment and we could have ended up at 9-9 and then who knows what might have happened? I hark back to the words of golfer, Gary Player: “It is strange but the more I practise, the luckier I become”. Wise words indeed!<br>
