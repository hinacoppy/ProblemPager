 <div class="description">One of the topics addressed by Michihito Kageyama and Roland Herrera in their excellent book, “Opening Concepts” is that of the 'Double Tiger'. A Double Tiger occurs when you hit twice in your home board and leave two blots. The ideas behind this type of play are twofold: to make the best use of your own checkers; to take tempo away from your opponent. <br>
<br>
The latter is particularly important. A lot of top-class backgammon is about preventing your opponent from carrying out his threats. A Double Tiger play means that your opponent will have to use the whole of his next roll (unless he rolls a double) to enter his checkers from the bar. He will be the favourite (just) to hit one of your exposed checkers but you would be unlucky if he hit both of them.<br>
<br>
A Double Tiger play normally occurs when your opponent does not have an anchor in your home board so that if things go well a blitz attack can be successful. Michy and Roland provide plenty of examples of Double Tiger Plays in their book.<br>
<br>
What about the situation where you already have a blot in your home board? When playing online last week I came across the position above.  51 is a particularly bad roll for Black. Before the advent of modern theory, I suspect that many would select as 8/3, 4/3 as their move. However, that play leaves a double shot for White and exerts no pressure on him whatsoever. <br>
<br>
The Double Tiger play here would be 13/8, 6/5* but that is not a true Double Tiger because White would only have one checker on the bar. Having considered the two plays already discussed I saw the opportunity for a Triple Tiger Play! What about 7/2*, 6/5*? It leaves three blots but it does put two White checkers on the bar. Can the play possible be correct?<br>
<br>
The simple answer is yes and in fact, any other play is a blunder or worse. The play puts pressure on White to perform or face a very aggressive blitz. Despite the fact that the play leaves 28 return shots it is by far the best move in the position! <br>
<br>
I think this position demonstrates just how far backgammon theory has evolved since the bots emerged twenty-five years ago. Very few of the early 'experts' would have even considered 7/2*, 6/5* although I would name Walter Cooke and Joe Dwek as exceptions to that statement.<br>
<br>
Double and Triple Tiger plays are now part of the armoury of modern day experts so you can expect to see backgammon become an even more aggressive game over the coming years as we really begin to understand just how important tempo is within the theory of the game.<br>
