 <div class="description">Unless you are competent with handling match equity tables you will not be able to determine your match-winning chances at any particular match score. The vast majority of backgammon players do not do any match equity calculations and live happy contented lives!<br>
<br>
However, even if you do not do match equity calculations you should know the correct strategies for key scores that recur time after time. 3-Away versus 2- Away is one such score. Long ago I learnt that it is correct to both double earlier than usual (especially with any gammon threat) and for the leading player to drop earlier. Even without any gammon threat the player at 2-Away needs 29% to take a double rather than the normal 25%.<br>
<br>
A key point is that this information can influence checker play. Let us look at this week’s position. White has just fanned and now Black has a 32 to play. He would like to make his 5-pt but that will be difficult with his current checker distribution. In a money game 11/6 would be correct. It balances risk (six shots) against reward (three builders for the five point). 11/9, 11/8 is slightly weaker as now there are only two builders for the 5-pt, but on the plus side White only hits with a 54.<br>
<br>
I had this position at 3-Away versus 2-Away and made the cardinal error of making the money play rather than thinking through the match score implications. I played 11/6 and when my opponent fanned again I correctly doubled although it is an easy take. Note that for money a double would have been grossly premature, but the gammon threat is sufficient to generate a double at the match score.<br>
<br>
Could I have done better? Indeed, I could, by playing a move I did not even consider! That move is 8/6, 8/5, slotting the point I most want to make. For money that play would be an error as even if White fans again Black does not have a double. <br>
<br>
However, at 3-Away versus 2-Away it is a very different story. If White fans again he must now drop Black’s double precisely because of the threat of losing a gammon and the match. It is remarkable what a difference the match score makes to the checker play and doubling decisions in this position.<br>
<br>
The equity difference between 11/6 and 8/6, 8/5 is not huge because, of course, when the slot gets hit after 8/6, 8/5 Black could lose a gammon and the match. Conversely, it is the ability to win the game on the next roll that makes the slot such a powerful play.<br>
<br>
I confess that I did not see this level of detail over the board but only after conducting a series of rollouts in the calm of my study. The complexity of backgammon never ceases to amaze me.<br>
