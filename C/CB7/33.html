Thanks to Martin for the match score analysis and take points (see comments).<br>
<br>
Most people don’t do this over the board either because they can’t or because they haven’t got the time. I am able to do these calculations but only do so in major tournaments as they take time and certainly on Gridgammon people would become impatient.  I use the Janowski formula to do my match equity calculations.<br>
<br>
Without doing the calculations I would reason as follows:<br>
<br>
This is somewhere around a three-roll position but with lots of potential misses for both sides so it could actually be a 1,2, 3 or 4-roll position. <br>
<br>
As Red if I redouble and win I will be 6-3 (Crawford) ahead and my opponent is on an odd number of points ahead which is very good for me.<br>
<br>
If I redouble and lose then I lose the match which is obviously bad for me buy hey you can't win them all.<br>
<br>
On roll and 1 pip behind I am favourite probably somewhere between 60 and 70%.<br>
<br>
The position is highly volatile so ‘taking a roll’ looks wrong – I should nearly certainly redouble now.<br>
<br>
Finally apply Woolsey’s Law and give the problem to White – Redouble!<br>
<br>
In fact Red is about 65% in this position. The take is trivial but the redouble is massively correct – it is more than a double blunder not to redouble.<br>
