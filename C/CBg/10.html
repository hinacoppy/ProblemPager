 <div class="description">When I had this position I fairly quickly played 13/9*/5, 7/3(2)*. My opponent entered with one checker and I cashed the game.<br>
<br>
I was amazed when I put this into XG that it preferred 8/4(2), 7/3(2)*. How can hitting one possibly be better than hitting two? All three of the ‘hit two’ plays have the same equity but they are 0.05 behind the hit one play.<br>
<br>
Normally when XG recommends a move I can quickly see why but here it took some time. What I think is going on is this:<br>
<br>
After the hit one play the only roll that allows White to take Red’s double next turn is 26 (bar/23/17*) and that is no bargain. After the hit two plays White can take after 11, 22 and 44 but now he has a much better position.<br>
<br>
It would seem that this possibility of White anchoring with an effective double is the difference between the plays which I think you would agree is something you wouldn’t have thought about when playing Red’s 44 – I certainly didn’t!<br>
