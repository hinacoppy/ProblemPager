 <div class="description">I have constantly reiterated just how complex match play can be, and much of that complexity arises from understanding the use of the doubling cube, particularly in short matches or towards the end of a long match where the scores are close. The key thing in any match is not how many points you have already won but how many more you need to win the match.<br>
<br>
In such situations gammons are crucial to the decision-making process. There is no short cut to the learning involved. I have played hundreds of short matches in the last three to four years on GridGammon and supplemented that by playing Extreme Gammon (XG) in Tutor Mode both on the PC and on XG Mobile. All the games on GridGammon are subsequently downloaded and then analysed using XG. Each error is then analysed and (hopefully) something is learnt from it. Key learning points are recorded and over time the blunders become fewer and the errors become smaller. That at least is the theory!<br>
<br>
Equally important when analysing is to understand when the correct play or decision in a crucial position has been made. XG doesn’t highlight these and so it requires some diligence to find and record them for future use. This week’s position is from one of my London League matches. It occurred in Roehampton’s match against Chelsea Arts and I was Black, playing against Brenda Rosen, the Chelsea captain. Brenda was leading 2-0 to 5.<br>
<br>
For money this would be a ludicrous double and a perfectly correct (and very large) beaver. However, at five-away versus 3-away things are very different. A gammon gets me to 4-2 (Crawford) and as we know getting to Crawford is very powerful. Secondly, Brenda will not to be able to redouble as she would in a money game as I will need only 15% chances to take a redouble to 4 (which I will automatically redouble to 8). Thus, she will be very slow to redouble.<br>
<br>
I have fifteen immediate hits (any 2 plus 31 and 61), all of which will give me reasonable gammon chances. In addition, because Brenda will not be redoubling any time soon, I will have additional winning chances as she bears in her remaining checkers. Remarkably, not doubling is a double blunder. I am pleased to say that my countless hours of practice and study paid off and I turned the cube to 2. Brenda accepted and then crucially I rolled 31, played bar/22, 13/12. I went on win a gammon by the narrowest of margins and then won the Crawford Game to win the match. <br>
<br>
Given that Roehampton won the overall match 10-8 it could be said that the win was down to making the correct decision in this position. Of course, that is not quite true, as my team colleagues provided great support but it is very rewarding when practice and study pays off.<br>
