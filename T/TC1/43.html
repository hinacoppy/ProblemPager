 <div class="description">Black would rather not leave a direct shot here, but he has no choice.<br>
Breaking anchor with 21/15 14/10 leaves far too many blots and shots, so his real choice is between leaving shots in the outfield and attacking on the 1pt.  Since Black has the stronger board and hitting minimizes return shots, hitting might seem to be the way to go.<br>
The trouble is that the blot on the 1pt is hard to cover even if it is not hit immediately, and hitting does not help with Black&#39;s need to clear his outfield points.  The rollout favors the unusual-looking 14/4, giving White a double shot at two blots in the outfield, but giving White a number of awkward rolls if she does not hit, as well as keeping the bar point (which prevents White from escaping the straggler with a 6).  This bold play is licensed in part by Black&#39;s stronger board; in the Variant position below, White has a four-point board as well, and 14/14 and 7/3 7/1* roll out very close.<br>
