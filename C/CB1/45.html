 <div class="description">Phil Simborg, backgammon teacher and guru, very kindly regularly sends out interesting positions from his chouette and he was happy for me to re-use this one.<br>
<br>
Should Red break the â€˜Dimitri Rule' (never double without a new home board point). He leads in the race, has cleared his rear checkers and has a broken five-point prime. Coupled with White's messy home board structure surely all that adds up to a double?<br>
<br>
Indeed it does but what I didn't appreciate when I first looked at this position was just how weak White's position is. If he had an anchor on Red's 3-pt then the position is only just a double but the problem for White is that he can be blitzed as well as all his other problems. That eventuality turns the position into a huge pass -  it's a double blunder to take.<br>
<br>
Phil normally only posts positions where someone errs so I assume one or more optimists took this one!<br>
