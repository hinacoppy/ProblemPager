<div class="description"><hr>
This was the final game of the night in Monday's Battersea chouette. The Box and his partner were White and actually held three 8 cubes and one 4 cube. <br>
<br>
They redoubled all the cubes and the all the team, including World Number 2 Giant, Michi, took. Red rolled 44(!) played 9/5, 8/4(2), 7/3 and then white rolled 26: bar/23, 24/18.<br>
<br>
Red then did escape a checker with a 6 but after an innocuous 32 from White, Red rolled 55 and it was all over. Red had to drop the redoubles to 32 and 16. <br>
<br>
Given the initial position has a high percentage for both sides there was the potential for a huge swing on this game, as we have just seen.<br>
<br>
The double by Red is clear because so many of White's entering numbers crunch his board. So what about the take? At the time we weren't sure but a long rollout establishes that this is a take by a small margin (0.039) and so dropping is a small error.<br>
<br>
One disadvantage for the box was having Michi on the team. Once he took everyone else on the team was also likely to take. Practical chouette management!<br>
