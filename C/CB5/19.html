 <div class="description">Black doubled this position and, without taking too much time, White passed. He had quickly employed the principle of PRAT (Position, Race, Threat) and determined that he was behind in all three. Such a situation normally implies a pass and ergo, he passed.<br>
<br>
However, I learned a long time ago that as a general rule, all general rules are wrong! PRAT is only meant as a guideline and not as an absolute method for making doubling decisions. There are situations, particularly towards the end of a game, where tactical analysis gives a much more accurate result than a general principle. This position ably demonstrates that point.<br>
<br>
If Black rolls a five or a six he will be a heavy favourite , although he will not win all twenty of those games. It is the other sixteen games that are of more interest. With any of those rolls Black must weaken his position and give White very real game-winning chances. His large numbers will escape Black’s home board while with ones and twos he will hit the Black checker in his home board. The position will then become highly volatile and White’s ownership of the doubling cube could well be crucial to the outcome of the game. <br>
<br>
Can we assume that White will win 50% or more of the games where Black doesn’t escape White’s board immediately? I think we can, plus he will won some games by racing or a late hit even when Black does escape.  Certainly White will lose some gammons but not enough to influence the correct decision. <br>
<br>
Of course Black should double but in fact White has a very clear take. He wins nearly 29% of the time from here. White was too hasty in his decision over the board – he should have done the tactical analysis before making his decision.<br>
<br>
However, as we know, backgammon is a game of small margins. Take the dead checker on Black’s ace-point and put it on his 4-pt and the position becomes a borderline take/pass. Place the checker on his 6-pt and it becomes a clear pass because now Black’s 21 and 32 no longer significantly damage his position.<br>
