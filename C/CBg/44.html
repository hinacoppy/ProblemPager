<div class="description"><hr>
This position occurs on page 190 of my latest book, “Backgammon in the Wind”, in the article entitled “Out of the Box”.<br>
<br>
It is one of the most analysed back game positions of all time as it led to the 17-point match being decided in one game with the cube on 32! I have analysed it many times over the years, first by hand and then using various software programs. In preparing the book for publication this is the one position I did not roll out again but relied on an old rollout.<br>
<br>
That was a mistake! What was a double a few years ago has now becaome a clear non-double. The position now obeys Kent Goulding's basic principle that you should not double such positions while you still have four points to clear from in front of the two back game anchors. White's timing is tenuous but sufficient for this rule to be obeyed. Walter Cooke (Red) should have held on to the cube. For Jesse Sammis (White) the take was trivial.<br>
<br>
On the last roll of the game Sammis held a 16-cube and needed to roll 66 to win. Recognising that being down 16-0 to 17 was hopeless he redoubled to 32 and promptly rolled 66. The match thus entered the history books!<br>
