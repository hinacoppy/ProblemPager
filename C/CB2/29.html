I love this one and my thanks to Leo for submitting it. Over the board virtually nobody would get this right. Presenting it in quiz format at least makes you think about it in more depth.<br>
<br>
Red would like to advance his rear checkers but advancing two of them with a play such as 24/18, 24/20 invites a double hit and a blitz attack and Red will still have the blot on his own 5-pt. What about 24/18, 5/1? Even worse – Red will need his 5-pt so this is no time to hide that blot.<br>
<br>
The correct play is the surprising 13/9, 13/7 offering a voluntary triple shot! Remember Magriel's Maxim: “put ‘em where you want ‘em.”<br>
<br>
The trick is to look ahead. Only nine of White's numbers hit two blots. With any of the single hitting rolls by White Red will still be well-placed to make a good new point next turn. Meanwhile, by keeping his anchor Red ensures he can't be blitzed.<br>
<br>
Most people will reject 13/9, 13/7 because leaving a voluntary triple shot is not a part of their backgammon model. Once you ‘see' the play it is highly logical – the trick is in seeing it in the first place. Anything other than 13/9, 13/7 is at least an error.<br>
