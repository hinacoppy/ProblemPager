 <div class="description">Eric McAlpine showed me this position. How would you play 44 as Black?<br>
<br>
Most players that Eric showed this position to went for 24/16, 13/9(2). You can make a case for 13/5(2) and possibly even 24/16, 13/5 with duplication of ones despite the two blots. Given that the race is close one brave fellow even went for 24/16, 20/16(2). Virtually nobody found the best play.<br>
<br>
This is a case of backgammon players being loth to change their principles when the position demands it. We are taught that we should not put checkers out of play voluntarily (dead men tell no tales). Everyone assumes that the checker on Black’s 5-pt still has a role to play in the game. After all, if Black can cover that blot he will have a five-point home board which could well be important and hence why 13/5(2) is a candidate play.<br>
<br>
The key point is that the blot on the 5-pt does have a role to play but it is a passive one. The correct play is 24/16, 20/16, 5/1. This move leaves a position where the race is even. Black has solved the problem of escaping his rear checker to safety and the position will be finely balanced. There will now be awkward rolls for both sides and the game may well be decided by who gets into trouble first.<br>
<br>
The point about 24/16, 20/16, 5/1 is that Black does not give White an immediate opportunity to gain the initiative. Black may have to release his mid-point next turn but by then White will have had to make a move. It is often wrong to give your opponent a gratuitous shot in an even game and that is the exactly the case here.<br>
<br>
The blot on the 5-pt must be sacrificed for the greater good. So many players got this position wrong precisely because they applied the wrong principle – do not kill the checkers. Because they applied this principle they were unable to even consider the correct move as a candidate play and if you do not see a play you cannot make it!<br>
<br>
In the cold light of day and given as a quiz question most players will solve this problem but that is not good enough. To succeed at backgammon you have to get the plays correct over the board. 24/16, 13/9(2) is an error, anything else is a blunder or worse.<br>
