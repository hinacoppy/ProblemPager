 <div class="description">Last week we looked at a position where the player of the back game should double before actually hitting a shot. This week we have a position where Black was playing a back game but now has two White checkers on his own side of the board, one of them on the bar. White has just made the mistake of fanning - is Black strong enough to double?<br>
<br>
If Black had a direct cover for the blot on his 5-pt I think most players would double but by then Black would have lost his market by a wide margin. In the actual position, Black has eight covering numbers but more importantly he is threatening to reach a position where White will have drop the double next turn. For example, if Black rolls 63 he will play 17/11, 13/10 and if White fans again or enters with an awkward number such as 13 then the position will be double and pass.<br>
<br>
The other key point is to reinforce what I said last week. If White does subsequently re-enter with a hit on Black’s 5-pt he will be nowhere near a redouble. His home board structure is awkward and Black will be taking for some time to come. The possibility of losing his market is sufficient for Black to turn the cube here and not doubling is actually a blunder. Of course, White has an easy take.<br>
<br>
This position actually occurred with Black trailing 0-2 in a 7-point match. Now the double is crystal clear. As the trailer in a match one needs to be more aggressive than in a money game. It may surprise you to learn that Black wins a higher percentage of gammons (20% versus 17%) than White from this position. As the trailer those gammons are very valuable and Black must double now while White still has a take. Not doubling at this match score is a triple blunder and although White has a take it is much closer to a drop than the equivalent position in a money game. <br>
<br>
As I have written before our knowledge of match-play doubling is really still in its infancy but studying positions such as this one can only help players improve that particular skill. Many strong players would still ‘take a roll’ here and double next turn if White fans. They might even be pleased with winning a point but they would have missed an opportunity to win four points. <br>
<br>
The key to winning backgammon, as Kit Woolsey pointed out long ago, is to consistently win two points or four points and not settle for one. Yes, there is more risk in doubling positions like this one but then the game is all about understanding risk and reward and balancing the two. Here, the reward fully justifies the risk.<br>
