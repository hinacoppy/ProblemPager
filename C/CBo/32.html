<div class="description"><hr>
The score is 1-1 to 5 and Black owns the cube on 2. If this were a money game a redouble by Black would be a massive error and it would be a proper beaver for White. However, this is match play and, as we have seen all year, the match score has a huge influence on doubling decisions. This is particularly true in short matches when one game can decide the outcome of the match.<br>
<br>
At 1-1 to 5 a doubled gammon will decide the match and if the cube reaches 4 then a single game will suffice.  In this position both of those conditions apply. If Black misses these shots then he is very likely to lose a gammon and the match.<br>
<br>
If Black doesn’t redouble now the cube will have future value and he can redouble later, get a pass, and go 3-1 ahead. However, White’s take point in this position is 33% - a long way from the normal 25%.<br>
<br>
Can Black lose his market here? Yes he can, very easily. He has 22 shots and any hit followed by a fan by White will take Black way beyond White’s take point. The position is highly volatile. Of course, Black could hit both White checkers and still lose, that is the nature of the game. Equally well he could just close out one White checker and then still lose – note that White has already borne off three checkers. <br>
<br>
Redoubling now removes gammons from the equation and naturally, White can never win with a future redouble – the game must be played to the end whatever happens.<br>
<br>
There are very few certainties in backgammon – that is one reason the game has fascinated us for 5,00 years. However, this is precisely the right moment for Black to redouble. White will hate it, but he has to take – although I have occasionally seen people drop redoubles like this.<br>
<br>
XG rates not redoubling as bad blunder. Black will win from this position just over 50% of the time but this game is now for the match so that is absolutely fine. This type of redouble is very common in short matches so always have the score in the back of your mind, take your time when such situations arise and then apply pressure by redoubling.<br>
