 <div class="description">Raj Jansari posted this position on Facebook and had trouble understanding XG’s recommendation. I had the same problem when I studied it so let us try to make sense of the bot’s suggestion.<br>
<br>
Before we come to that suggestion let us eliminate a few other plays. 13/6 leaves Black vulnerable to rolling 61 next turn so that cannot be right. 8/5, 8/5 eliminates the 61 problem but now Black will have more trouble clearing his mid-point. In certain variations he will want to keep his 8-pt so that he can play a roll of 5x by moving 13/x, 13/8, giving White a single shot. Moving 8/5, 8/4 eliminates those variations so again that cannot be right.<br>
<br>
In positions like this XG’s strategy is to move inside the home board so as to give Black more time to roll a clearing double and never leave a shot. However, it is how you move within the home board that now becomes the focus of this problem. <br>
<br>
Black will want to keep some fives to play later so playing 6/3, 6/2 is not the right idea. Equally well Black will not want to leave a hole in his home board on the 4-pt or 5-pt that will cause him to miss with one of those number later in the bear-off. This should eliminate 5/2, 5/1.  6/2, 4/1 is better but risks a later hole on the 4-pt. 5/1, 4/1 is very similar to 6/2, 4/1.<br>
<br>
So, what does that leave us with? The answer is XG’s recommendation of 6/3, 5/1 – a somewhat strange looking play. 6/3, 5/1 leaves a five to play later, fills the current hole on the 1-pt (without overcrowding it) and leaves the same number of checkers on the 6-pt and 5-pt which XG seems to approve of.<br>
<br>
I performed a long rollout of this position and 6/3, 5/1 comes out top by a long way. The next two plays, 5/2, 5/1 and 5/1, 4/1 are tied but with an equity difference 0.06 less than 6/3, 5/1 which implies a big error for any move other than the correct play.<br>
<br>
Can we be sure that XG has got this one right. I believe so. This Is a relatively simple position to play (except of course getting the first move right!) and I would not expect a neural net program to make any mistakes from here. That means that we need to learn to think more about the ideas and analysis that I have gone through above. These ideas are perhaps more important than I would have thought, and I have certainly learnt something by analysing this position so my thanks to Raj for posting it in the first place.<br>
