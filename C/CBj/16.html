<div class="doAction">Match Play. Red trails 2-3 to 5. Should Red double? If doubled, should White take?</div>

 <div class="description">A difficult problem: Red leads in the race and can release one checker from his 17-pt when two of his checkers will then be holding four of White's.<br>
<br>
For money it would be a huge mistake to double as the position has very low volatility and other than 33 and 44 Red has no potential market losers. The match score has some influence however because getting to 4-3 Crawford is a big advantage for Red.<br>
<br>
However, the very low volatility and the very low gammon percentage mean that Red should wait. This position actually occurred at UK Open with Red being Chris Rogers and White being Mochy. I think (but can't prove) that the disparity in skill makes the double reasonable rather than an error which is how XG rates it.<br>
<br>
Chris rolled 51 (10/5, 6/5) and then Mochy rolled 62 which he correctly played 13/11, 13/7 as then if Red hits with 33 he has to break his home board. Chris missed the shot and after a long battle Chris misplayed a vital 41 in the bear-off, got hit, and Mochy won the game and match.<br>
