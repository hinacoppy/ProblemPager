<div class="description"><hr>
This position came up in the Battersea chouette and left Jon Barnes (White) with a difficult decision. Black was on his own as the other team members had dropped Jon’s original double. Black had turned the game around and now offered a redouble to Jon in this week’s position? What would you do? Is your glass half full or half empty?<br>
<br>
Many players would drop very quickly but Jon did what every good player should do and took his time over the decision. First, he counted Black’s cover numbers of which there are 18. Unless Black rolls a succession of small doubles and crashes his home board after covering he will win those 18 games. <br>
<br>
The next question is will Black leave his 6-pt slotted if he does not cover? In most cases the answer to that question is yes because he needs his 6-pt to win the game. So, for example, 32 will be played 15/12, 10/8. Only if he rolls something like 55 will he safety the blot on the 6-pt. <br>
<br>
Jon reckoned to hit the exposed blot about one time in three which would give him six hits and, not only very likely six wins, but also some gammons as well. That point is crucial.  Sometimes Black will not cover the blot on the 6-pt at the second attempt and, although he may then lift the blot ,whatever he does will give White further winning chances. Jon estimated that would give him one more win and so he is now up to seven. Of course, he may also win with a late shot in the bear-off but that possibility is relatively remote.<br>
<br>
After long thought, Jon decided that his gammon wins would compensate for the fact that he would only win on average, seven out of thirty-six games (he needs nine to take). He therefore took the double and was rewarded when his opponent failed twice to cover and on his second attempt he rolled the crucial six. He didn’t win the gammon be he did win four points.<br>
<br>
A long XG rollout confirms that the take is correct but only by 0.012 equity points! So an excellent piece of analysis by Jon and he was rewarded for having a half full glass!<br>
