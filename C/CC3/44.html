 <div class="description">This position is certainly volatile and therefore, with gammons abounding, Red must double.<br>
Red had only one game plan, the blitz. If that fails, he is likely to be in trouble as his checkers are somewhat disjointed. At the moment he has 10 checkers in the attack zone and two nearby.<br>
Move one checker from Red’s mid-point to his 10-pt and the position becomes a pass but in the actual position White has a very comfortable take. Other than his two checkers on the bar he has no other weaknesses and his structure is sound. A good percentage of the time he will make an anchor in Red’s home board.<br>
White will win the game 33% of the time, his only problem is that when he loses two-thirds of the time that loss will be a gammon.<br>
Huge double, huge take. Dropping is worse than a double blunder.<br>
