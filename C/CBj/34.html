 <div class="description">IIt is a remarkable fact that every backgammon player that I have ever met is unlucky! The problem is that players always remember their bad luck but seem to forget their own pieces of good fortune such as successive 16’s from the bar or a couple of large doubles in the bear-off to win a seemingly lost race.<br>
<br>
In short matches there is always a lot of luck. That can be clearly seen from the XG analysis of such matches. Quite often, in matches between good players, the equity lost through luck is greater than the equity lost through errors and blunders. This is true for players who have a Performance Rating (PR) around 4. Once you get up to PRs around 8 then the luck is dominated by the errors/blunders.<br>
<br>
However, over time luck truly does even out. Over my last 2,000 online matches my average luck is 0.0001 equity points, or in other words, truly insignificant.  Once you come to terms with such statistics you realise that over time, your skill or lack of it, will dominate your results.<br>
<br>
People also believe that they are unlucky against particular players, no matter what they do. I have always complained that I can never beat my good friend, Romolo Mudu. At the Cotswolds tournament  last weekend I met Romolo in the final of the warm-up event. In the final to five points I was leading 1-0 and looked good for a gammon holding a 2-cube when something went wrong and I lost the game and then the match. QED.<br>
<br>
We then met again on the Sunday in the quarter-final of the main. We reached 4-4 to 11 when the above position occurred. I was Black and had to play 52. I obviously cannot give up my home board and so I made the correct play of 13/6 leaving Romolo only 45 and 46 to hit and cover. Lo and behold out popped 45 which he played 16/12*, 8/3.<br>
<br>
Here we go again, I thought - I’ll probably lose a gammon and go 4-8 behind. That was before I rolled 44 from the bar. Hardly believing it, I played bar/21/17*/13*/9* putting three of Romolo’s checkers on the bar! I went on to win a gammon and lead 8-4. From there I won the match and then, buoyed by this superb roll, the next two matches as well to win the tournament. My Romolo curse had finally be laid to rest and even I had to agree that I had been remarkably lucky!<br>
