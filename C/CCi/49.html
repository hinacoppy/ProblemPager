 <div class="description">I got this one wrong. Clearly this is a massive double for Red in a very volatile position. <br>
I thought it was a pass, but XG has it as a comfortable take. All of White’s checkers are in play and if he can make his 9-pt he will have a good block. If the outside blot is hit White may anchor. If hit he may hit back and then his three-point home board will come into play.<br>
I didn’t think these possibilities would compensate for the gammons losses but apparently that is the case. Red wins a gammon more than half the time but White wins more than a third of the games.<br>
There are times when it is hard to agree with XG and for me this was one of them. However, it is far cleverer than I am so double/take it is. I also learnt a lot by rolling out this position a few times which is a great way to learn. Give it a try.<br>
