<div class="description"><hr>
Thanks to the bots we are slowly getting better at back games. The person playing the back game has a relatively straightforward game plan. He must prepare his home board to contain an eventual hit checker. Meanwhile he keeps the two points that he has in his opponent’s home board and recirculates any extra checkers as quickly as he can, hoping to preserve his timing so that when he gets a shot it will be a winning one if he hits it.<br>
<br>
It has long been recognised that the 1-3 and 2-3 back games give the best long-term winning chances but any two points, other than 1-5 game, which is really an ace-point game with a few extra chances, give the defender reasonable winning chances.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the player trying to beat the back game must take care when bearing in but while his opponent’s home board is still weak he can slow himself down by getting his own checkers hit and recirculated. Once the opponent has a strong home board that tactic has to be discarded in favour of safety.<br>
<br>
As a guide, and against a well-timed back game, he will offer a double when he still has three points to clear in front of the defender’s most advanced anchor. Should the back game player’s position lack timing then the double may well come earlier. <br>
<br>
The other key point is to know when to transition from holding points to clearing them. Eventually any points outside (and inside) the home board must be cleared so that at some point in time they cease to be assets and become liabilities.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is a clear demonstration of not understanding that principle. Faced with double threes to play, Black decided to keep his blocking points and moved 10/7(2), 10/4. This play leaves an ugly rigid structure and gives White the opportunity to transition from a 2-5 back game to a 2-3 back game if he rolls an ace next turn.<br>
<br>
The correct idea is to destroy the 2-3 option while at the same time clearing an awkward point now. The correct play is 10/7, 6/3(3)*!! We are used to holding on to our 6-pt until late in the game and certainly until the vast majority of our checkers have reached the home board.  This position clearly demonstrates that general rules are made to be broken. The 3-pt provides a good landing point for Black’s future fives and, of course, it forces White to commit to the 2-5 back game, which is definitely the poorer cousin of the 2-3 back game.<br>
<br>
Any move other than 10/7, 6/3(3)* is at least a blunder.<br>
