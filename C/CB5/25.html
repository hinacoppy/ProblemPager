 <div class="description">The sun was high in the morning sky when Bertram finally awoke to find that Jeeves had just produced the essential pot of tea and had placed it by his master’s bedside.<br>
<br>
“Might I enquire, sir, how the evening chouette at the Drones went?”.<br>
<br>
“You may well ask, Jeeves,” I replied with some asperity. “Oofy Prosser, the club millionaire, now has even more of the stuff while decent chaps, like Pongo Twistleton, become ever poorer.” <br>
<br>
“ I assume therefore, sir, that you did not have a winning evening?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed not. I also contributed to the Prosser portfolio. We just never seemed to have any luck and Oofy just rolled whatever numbers he needed. Look at this position, Jeeves. Pongo, Tuppy Glossop and I were the team facing Oofy (White) in the box.<br>
<br>
“We discussed our 62 and it seemed obvious to us to make our 9-pt with 11/9 and then start to  get our back checkers moving by playing 24/18 with the six. Needless to say, Oofy rolled 33, playing 13/7(2)* and then we stayed on the bar with our own 33. One more roll and we had to drop his double. So you see, Jeeves, pure bad luck.”<br>
<br>
“Sadly, sir, I think not. Your opponent had the better home board and so this was not the moment to encourage an attack. Making your own 5-pt with 11/5, 7/5, leaving three blots would be too big a play, but I think you will find that 11/5, 9/7, slotting the key 5-pt and duplicating White’s fours, or 11/9, 10/4, creating a strong broken prime are both far superior to your team’s move.”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord, Jeeves, do you know I don’t think we even looked at those plays.”<br>
<br>
“I thought perhaps not, sir. Now, which suit shall I lay out for your lunch with your Aunt Agatha?”<br>
