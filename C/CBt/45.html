It is very different playing in the final of a major backgammon tournament than just having a few games with a friend. Pressure does strange things to even the best players. That is true of all games and sports. To give but three examples; in 1993 Jana Novotna led Steffi Graf 4-1, 40-30 in the final set of the Wimbledon final, she then served the most iconic double fault in tennis history and collapsed; in 1996 Newcastle United blew a twelve point lead over Manchester United in the Premiership and lost the title; in 1999 Jan Van de Welde held a three shot on the 18th tee at Carnoustie and then sensationally took a seven and subsequently lost in the play-off. <br>
<br>
These are classic examples of what is known as ‘choking’. The reasons for choking can be many and various but the concept is neatly summarised by one of my favourite quotes of all time from Olympic oarsman Matthew Pinsent: <br>
<br>
“Lack of skill, discipline or fitness are common among all but the top layer of sportspeople. Once you get to the top, it's pressure, the influence of the opposition or mental toughness.”<br>
<br>
Choking in backgammon is a fairly frequent occurrence, quite often caused by either the prestige of the event or sometimes, the size of the prize pot. At the recent Cyprus Open Aurelien Bonnet, very sadly for him, gave a classic demonstration of choking in the final against Franck Stepler.<br>
<br>
He had lost the first match of the final at Double Match Point when he failed to throw a six to hit an exposed blot. This meant, in the Double Elimination format, that a second match was required. After one game he led 1-0 to 9. In the next game he held the cube on 2 and inexplicably cashed the game when he should have played on for the gammon, for which he was a massive favourite. At 3-0 he again failed to play on for a gammon when it was clear to do so.<br>
<br>
At 6-6 he yet again erred on the side of caution and merely won a single point rather than play on for the gammon which would have given him an 8-6 lead with the Crawford Game to come.<br>
<br>
So far, he had got away with his ultra-cautious style, but the backgammon gods had seen enough and at 7-6 he made his final calamitous error in this week’s position. Consider for a moment how you would play this 61 as Black.<br>
<br>
20/13, prematurely leaving the anchor is clearly wrong but Bonnet’s choice of 7/6, 7/1 is just as bad. When your opponent has a lone back checker the correct tactic is to attack it and this 61 gives Black the opportunity to do so. The only move in this position that is not a sextuple blunder or worse is 13/7, 5/4*.<br>
<br>
If White stays on the bar Black can cash the game and move to 8-6 (Crawford) ahead although White might mistakenly take the double (which is even better for Black).<br>
<br>
After Black’s 7/6, 7/1 play, White rolled 53 and played 21/13. Note he would have stayed on the bar if Black had play correctly. On his next roll Stepler correctly doubled and subsequently won two points. He then won the Crawford Game to win the match.<br>
<br>
I am sure that in regulation play Bonnet would have found 13/7, 5/4* but the pressure of the day found him out and he paid a terrible price for choking. Hopefully he will have learnt from the experience and will do better next time.<br>
