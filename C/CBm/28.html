Congratulations to Didier Assaraf of France in becoming the 49th Backgammon World Champion. He went undefeated through the main event, which is now played in double elimination format. In the final he defeated Petko Konstadinov of the US 19-9. Konstadinov led 9-7 but didn’t score another point.<br>
<br>
There were some notable British successes: Eric McAlpine and Jon Barnes won the doubles tournament and a third Brit, Tim Line, was on the losing side in the final. The Ladies World Championship was won by Anna Clarke who defeated yet another Brit, Cecilia Sparke, in the final. Well done to all those players and an honourable mention to Lawrence Powell who reached the quarter-finals in the main event. All we need now is a British winner of the main event, perhaps in 2018? <br>
<br>
An excellent way of learning is to watch videos of the matches from Monte Carlo and then study the XG analysis of the same match. I do this by watching three games on video, listening to the commentary (if there is one) and then I look at the same three games on XG to see how well my own thinking was in tune (or not) with the players and the commentators. Finally, I record any positions which I or the players got badly wrong for further analysis. I find this approach hugely beneficial in improving my own play and then I can pass on the lessons learnt to my pupils, one of whom is the above-mentioned Anna Clarke.<br>
<br>
The video of the final is on YouTube and can be found here: <br>

The commentary on the final was given by Falafel and Matt Cohn-Geier with assistance from Phil Simborg. Their commentary was very insightful and importantly, good fun to listen to. Thers is nothing worse than listening to humour-free commentary!<br>
<br>
This week’s positions is a simple error by the new World Champion in an early-game position from the final. Didier played this double four by moving 18/10, 13/9(2). This play might be safer for one roll but it passes up the chance to make the key asset of Black’s 5-pt. The simple 13/5(2) is correct and Didier’s play was a double blunder. As falafel said in commentary, “when you have the chance to make the 5-pt, make it and then think later!” <br>
<br>
There are obviously exceptions to that rule but you won’t go far wrong by following Falafel’s advice.<br>
