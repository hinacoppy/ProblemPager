 <div class="description">Out on the main lawn at Harbinger Hall preparations were well under way for the Easter Fair which would be held the following day. However, the Dowager Duchess had weightier matters on her mind as she tried to recover her losses in the chouette which had been running for many hours in the library.<br>
<br>
As ever, Graves had been supplying fresh pots of coffee at regular intervals to keep the protagonists fueled with caffeine. For once the Duchess, who was the team captain, looked to be coasting to victory when she managed to produce one her worst rolls, double fours, in this position. Quentin Quickcube, who held the box as White, treated himself to small smile.<br>
<br>
“The fates conspire against me,” said DD. “Why couldn’t I just roll a six and win the game?”.<br>
<br>
“No matter,” said the Tempestuous Turk. “We must make the most of what we have. It is clear to me that we should play 8/4(2), 7/3(2) and hope that QQ doesn’t escape with a six.”<br>
<br>
“Not a big enough play,” opined Barry Bigplay. “I think we must play 5/1(2)* with two of the fours and then simply play 8/4(2) with the other two. Hopefully QQ will stay on the bar and give us time to escape our rear checkers.”<br>
<br>
“I can’t say I like either play,” said DD. “What are your thoughts, EE?”<br>
<br>
“Much clearer than any of my teammates, I suspect,” replied the Enigmatic Englishman.<br>
<br>
“This is still a prime versus prime position and so we must treat it at such. TT’s play leaves an ugly structure while BB’s offering is completely the wrong idea. We want QQ to break his outside prime so we must give him time to do so. To preserve as much of our own prime as possible we must play 8/4(2), 6/2(2). This maintains a five-point broken prime against QQ’s rear checker. If he rolls a 5 then so be it, but all his other big numbers force him to dismantle his prime which is exactly our game plan.<br>
<br>
“It is not enough in backgammon to just make moves. You need to make moves that play to the best possible game plan in any given position and that is precisely what 8/4(2), 6/2(2) does here.”<br>
<br>
“Excellent and cogent analysis as ever, EE,” said the Dowager Duchess. “Now you have explained it all, 8/4(2), 6/2(2) is very clear and that is what we will play. Graves, I think perhaps it is time to move on to something a little stronger than coffee. Kindly open the bar and bring me a large a gin and tonic. I suspect my colleagues may well wish to join me.”<br>
