<div class="description"><hr>
Preparations for the New Year’s Ball were well advanced and all day the guests had been arriving at Harbinger Hall. The grounds were blanketed in snow and only a few hardy souls could be seen taking a walk as the light began to fade.<br>
<br>
No thought of exercise had crossed the minds of those engaged in the last chouette of the year in the library. With a roaring fire in the grate and Graves dispensing hot toddies the combatants were lost in their own world. As the alcohol consumption increased so the discussions became more vociferous. <br>
<br>
As we join them Quentin Quickcube has the box as White. The team captain is the Dowager Duchess (DD), ably assisted by Barry Bigplay (BB), Cautious Cuthbert (CC) and the Enigmatic Englishman(EE). DD has just rolled a slightly awkward 21.<br>
<br>
“When in doubt, hit,” said BB. “I would play 10/9*/7 and put a third checker behind our four-point prime.” <br>
<br>
“What’s wrong with 23/21, 6/5, keeping a broken five-point prime and leaving nothing for QQ to attack?” enquired CC.<br>
<br>
“I don’t like that play, CC,” replied DD. “Those stacked points look ugly and can’t be efficient. Some of our sixes net turn could be very difficult to play. I’m more inclined to go with BB’s move. What is your opinion, EE?”.<br>
<br>
“This is not an easy decision because we have to balance defence with attack. The problem with BB’s move is that our four-point prime will have three checkers sitting on top of it that are largely redundant. Meanwhile, we must consider our own rear checkers. If we leave them where they are then numbers like 62 and 64 will be very awkward on our next turn.<br>
<br>
“While hitting is often correct I think in this instance we should eschew the hit. I prefer 23/22, 5/3. This does three things: it keeps a five-point broken prime with two checkers trapped behind it; it diversifies the numbers for our rear checkers and it starts a useful point in our home board.<br>
<br>
“As you know I have emphasized the strength of broken primes all year and this position is a classic demonstration of the power of such primes.”<br>
<br>
“An erudite explanation, EE, and having heard it I must agree with you. 23/22, 5/3 it is. Graves, I think perhaps another round of drinks is called for. Would you be so kind?”<br>
