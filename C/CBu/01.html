When teaching I stress how important it is to maintain a strong home board when you need to hit a late shot to win the game. To that end I coined Bray’s Law which states: “When hoping to hit a late shot to win a game you should only break up your home board upon pain of death or because there is no other legal play.” The reason for the law is that if your home board breaks up not only do you have to hit a shot, you have to constrain that hit checker with an imperfect board. That makes the task much more difficult.<br>
<br>
The Law has stood me in good stead over the years and it constantly aids my decision making. However, as with all laws there are bound to be exceptions and in a match in Cyprus John Hurst managed to find one of them. Hoping to roll a nice small number such as 21 or 32, which lets him maintain all his key points, he (Black) rolled 43.<br>
<br>
He looked at 13/6 but that leaves a direct shot and cedes the outer boards to White. Next, he considered 21/18, 6/2 but that leaves White any 8 and he will also hit with virtually any 1 or 2, far too risky. What about 21/18, 21/17? That play leaves any seven or eight (12 numbers) and in addition Black is racing when behind which is the wrong strategy<br>
<br>
In the end John correctly decided that Bray’s Law did not apply and played 5/1, 4/1. This play has the merit of maintaining the status quo in the outer boards and not killing any checkers (the 5- and 4-pts can subsequently be remade).<br>
<br>
My play was a small error. Because Black may well get a shot next turn, he should limit his inner board blots to one. This means choosing between 6/3, 6/2 and 5/2, 5/1. Technically the best play in this position is 6/3, 6/2 because the 6-pt will be slightly easier to remake than the 5-pt since it is closer to Black’s outer board checkers.<br>
<br>
So, the lesson here is to remember to apply Bray’s Law in most situations where you are trying to win the game by hitting a late shot but always remember there will be exceptions. My compliments to John for finding his play over the board.<br>
