 <div class="description">This is an excellent reference position.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I hope everyone recognises that is is a very powerful double. Red’s four-point prime is very strong while White’s structure is poor. There are lots of market losing sequences so Red must double now.<br>
<br>
Give Red his 4-pt instead of his 8-pt and this becomes a massive pass but on the positive side for White, he Is ahead in the race, all his checkers are in play (although they are not ideally placed) and Red’s home board is only as strong White’s (key point).<br>
<br>
It’s no bargain but it would be an error for White to drop this. It is worth moving things around slightly to see what turns a take into a pass. Move the third checker on Red’s mid-point to his 9-pt, thus giving him a four-and-a-half point prime and four pips less in the race and it becomes a blunder to take. Tricky game, backgammon.<br>
