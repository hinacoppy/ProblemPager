 <div class="description">This is all about knowing reference positions. If both White checkers were closed out this would be a big pass. As a reference (one that most players should know) two closed out checkers plus two White checkers on the ace-point is a very close pass. <br>
<br>
Here White may anchor but Red should then execute a trap play to separate the rear checkers. Alternatively White may anchor, roll an ace and get a third checker sent back.<br>
<br>
Over the board I would balance the above variations with the fact that White's three home board checkers are on his 2-pt and not his ace-point and come to the conclusion that this will be a borderline decision.<br>
<br>
That in fact is the case and XG rates this as close (0.018) pass. However, if Red was a weak player who would make a six-point prime against an anchor rather than executing a trap play then the position becomes a take. So here you have not only to analyse the position but also your opponent.<br>
