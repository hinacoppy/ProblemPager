 <div class="description">The US teacher, Phil Simborg, posted this position on Facebook and admitted he had made the wrong play over the board in his chouette. He didn’t say which play he actually made but I suspect he moved something like 17/14, 2/1, bringing one of the outfield checkers closer to home. So what is the correct play?<br>
<br>
I remember in one of the early London Open tournaments in the decisive game, the winner, John Hurst, rolled what everyone assumed was a lucky 65 to hit an outfield blot which led to him subsequently winning the game and match. However, when analysing the match later it became evident that his opponent should not have left John the opportunity to roll that 65, he should have played completely safe.<br>
<br>
Today’s position mirrors that problem. Should Black split his rear checkers to facilitate bringing them into his home board? 17/14, 2/1 certainly makes it easier to bring home the checker from the 14-pt. The problem is that it leaves White three shots that win the game for him immediately and that is three shots too many.  The point is that White has a perfect prime so there is no life after death for Black if he is hit. Black must play safely with 17/15(2).<br>
<br>
That may lead to problems next turn with some sixes, but the key point is that there will be no problems this turn at the precise moment when White’s board is at its most potent<br>
<br>
Give it one more roll and White’s prime will very likely be weakened, even if, say, he rolls 43 and plays 7/4, 7/3. Any weakness in White’s prime, which gives Black some chances even if hit, are sufficient to allow Black to play with more freedom. If, for example, you take one of the checkers from White’s 2-pt and put it on his 3-pt then 17/15(2) becomes nearly a double blunder and 17/13 is the correct play.<br>
<br>
It is only by studying variations from the initial position that you get a fuller understanding of the necessary strategy and tactics that you must employ. The key lesson is that you should not take ANY unnecessary risks when a hit by your opponent will result in an immediate loss of the game. This idea can be extended well beyond this particular position. It is also important to learn how much risk you can take dependent upon the weaknesses in your opponent’s structure.<br>
<br>
What started out as a relatively simple position has given us a way to think about risk and reward in many similar positional types. Thus, our backgammon knowledge is once again increased by a small increment. These small increments all add up and over time we become better players, always assuming we remember the lessons!<br>
