<div class="description"><hr>
Whenever you roll a double it is worth taking a little extra time over the move because there are likely to be multiple choices. That was the case with Black’s double threes in this week’s position. Over the board he played the apparently sensible 21/18(2), 8/2. This play escapes the rear checkers, tidies up the blot on the 2-pt and gives Black a small lead in the race. <br>
<br>
A very reasonable play and at Double Match Point it is tied with 21/18(2), 8/5(2) as the best play. However, the position occurred in a money game and Black not only has to make a move but also think about his game plan. The doubling cube is still centred so that must part of his thinking.<br>
<br>
White has a single rear checker so Black should be thinking about attacking it if he can. 7/1(2)* is  clearly not the right idea but how about planning to attack next turn if things go favourably for him? This thinking will lead Black to find 8/5(2), 7/4(2). Now his four-and-a-half point board is a real threat and White must take some action. Not only does he have the blot on Black’s ace-point to worry about, but he also has to worry about the blot on his 11-pt.<br>
<br>
Let’s give White a 32 after Black plays 8/5(2), 7/4(2). He will play 11/6. Now Black has a very dynamic position and he has a good double which White will take. Black will then mount an attack against White’s rear checker and if successful he will win a fair percentage of gammons. <br>
<br>
The ability to double efficiently and the prospect of gammons is what makes 8/5(2), 7/4(2) a stronger move than 21/18(2), 8/2. Neither of those factors come into play at Double Match Point and so of course Black needs a different game plan for that special score.<br>
<br>
Black wins about 7% more gammons with 8/5(2), 7/4(2) and that is enough to make 21/18(2), 8/2 a small error as far as XG is concerned. Once you make the move the strength of it becomes obvious, but you can only make the play if you see it in the first place. If Black has his ‘safety first’ cap on he will never consider the move and the chance will be lost. So, always try to think ahead and have a clear idea of your game plan.<br>
