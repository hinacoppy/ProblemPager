 <div class="description">The Dowager Duchess was hosting her annual Derby Day party at Harbinger Hall. On a glorious summer’s day Graves had been kept busy dispensing champagne and Pimm’s to the assembled throng. There was keen anticipation for the race and money was changing hands as bets were made.<br>
<br>
However, there were a couple of hours to kill before the main event and rather than watch the earlier races the usual suspects were quick to start a chouette on the terrace. The Tempestuous Turk (White) had been in the box for a couple of games, riding his luck, when he was forced into a 2-5 back game in the following game. DD was the captain when this 33 tumbled out of the cups.<br>
<br>
“Not too much to think about here,” said DD. “13/7(2) looks very clear to me. Anyone disagree?”<br>
<br>
“Shouldn’t we be making our 3-pt with two of the threes?” enquired Barry Bigplay. “I don’t like that gap in our home board.”<br>
<br>
“So long as you don’t want to make our 1-pt as well!” said DD, somewhat quizzically.<br>
<br>
“I was thinking of 13/10(2), 6/3(2),” replied BB, with some asperity<br>
<br>
“It’s certainly worth thinking about,” said DD. “What do you think, EE?”<br>
<br>
The Enigmatic Englishman, as was his way, was still studying the position but finally joined in the debate.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I don’t like either of those plays. BB’s play is superficially attractive but it leaves us with too many stripped points. Against a back games spares are often more important than points. The trouble with DD’s play is that it severely proscribes our sixes which may have to be played from our bar-point.<br>
<br>
“As I said spares are crucial in such position but we must also look at how specific numbers play. We cannot eliminate all our bad numbers, such is the nature of back games, but we can give ourselves more flexibility with13/10(2), 11/8(2).”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord,” said DD. “I didn’t even see that move as a candidate play but now you have mentioned it looks to be a genuine contender.”<br>
<br>
“My dear DD, I think you will find that any other move is, in modern parlance, a blunder. Once we have cleared the 10-pt most of our sixes won’t play and we will slow ourselves down. Given that TT’s timing for a back game is tenuous I think you will find that 13/10(2), 11/8(2) maximises our winning chances.”<br>
<br>
“As ever, EE, your logic is impeccable and we shall make your play. Graves, the tide would appear to have gone out in my glass of Pimm’s. A refill if you please.”<br>
