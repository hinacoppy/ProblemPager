<div class="description"><hr>
For a change here is a full-length article taken from one of my Times newspaper articles in 2023. My column appears every Friday morning.<br>
<br>
Probably the most common mistake in backgammon is to agonise over two ways to play a dice roll, call them Play A and Play B, without ever realising that there is a third choice, Play C. That move turns out to be not only viable but actually stronger than either A or B.<br>
<br>
A complete oversight is one reason for missing a play but more often it is because Play C doesn’t fit with the player’s mental model of how backgammon should be played and so the move is rejected without much thought.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is a demonstration of this in practice. Black trails 3-4 to 5 and this is the Crawford Game so, ideally, he would like to win a gammon. He has a 52 to play. Most people given this as a problem choose either 11/4 or 8/6, 8/3. Of these plays 8/6, 8/3 is by far the stronger because it clears the troublesome 8-pt at the cost of four shots.<br>
<br>
When asked to find Play C everybody chooses 6/4, 6/1 even though they know that is unlikely to be correct. The true Play C is 8/3, 6/4. Nobody finds that move because they don’t see why they should expose a blot to a direct six by White. But that shot is an optical illusion.<br>
<br>
What they fail to realise, as did I when I had this position in a match, is that the only six White can afford to hit with is double sixes. Hitting with any of the other sixes creates a very high risk of losing a gammon because of all the loose White blots. The risk is so high that White cannot to take it.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile 8/3, 6/4 gives Black a much better distribution for the bear-off. 8/6, 8/3 creates an unwieldy structure and is rated by XG as a bad error. Meanwhile, 11/4 is a big blunder.<br>
<br>
None of my students has ever got this problem right because 8/3, 6/4 never makes it into their list of candidate plays. To state the obvious, if you do not see a move, you cannot play it. This problem should encourage you to consider all aspects of a position before choosing your move.<br>
