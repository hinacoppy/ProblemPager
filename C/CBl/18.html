 <div class="description">Good to see a nice healthy debate on this one from the regular contributors - many thanks to all of you.<br>
<br>
This is cross between a blitz and a prime vs. prime but more often the latter.<br>
<br>
White's home board position is very powerful and will lead to him winning a lot of games when Red's blitz fails or Red can't escape his rear checkers.<br>
<br>
However, Red is on roll and attacking and will win a fair number of gammons (more than half his wins are gammons). The position is highly volatile so Red should double now (not doubling is not quite a blunder). Equally well White has a lot of ways to win and has a very easy take (worse than a quadruple blunder to pass!). Note that 25% of White's wins will be gammons.<br>
<br>
First appearances can be deceptive and Red's position looks more dangerous than it is. He will attack with any hitting number (31 must be played 6/2*) but if White return hits he may well turn the position around very quickly.<br>
