 <div class="description">b) If Red doubles and White takes, how should Red play 44?<br>
<br>
Apologies for the delay â€“ my travels were extended by a day.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Tim and Alastair for their comments which are well worth reading.<br>
<br>
In match play I normally think about what I would do for money and then adapt that thinking to take account of the match score. For money this is a very clear double but perhaps surprisingly also a very clear take. That gap on the 3-pt is the major factor because it can lead to a lot of shots.<br>
<br>
If it's a clear money take then I'd be wary of doubling at this match score as the cube will be coming back on 4. Analysis proves this to be correct and the double is a big error but not quite a blunder. The take is trivial.<br>
<br>
After double/take what about the 44? The first instinct might be to clear the 7-pt with 7/3(4). However. Red will then probably have to leave a 9-shot at a blot on the 11-pt and White will have four hitting numbers. That is too many and Red does better to play the simple 11/3(2), after which he may never have to leave a shot.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, in positions like this if Red can clear points and only leave the prospect of a 17-1 shot it is often (but not always) right to do so.<br>
