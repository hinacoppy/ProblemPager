 <div class="description">This position arose earlier this week in the London league match between Roehampton and The Cumberland. I was White and leading 3-1 to 5. My adversary was long-time backgammon colleague, Raymond Kershaw, author of the excellent “Backgammon Funfair”.<br>
<br>
How should Ray play his 51? Of course, we would all knowthe answer to this straight away if we had recently read Bob Wachtel’s fine book, “In the game until the end”, which is dedicated to problems such as this one. However, we forget things over time, and Ray couldn’t recall the correct play.<br>
<br>
The choices are (a) 3/off, 2/1* and (b) 3/off, 3/2. Both plays leave eleven immediate shots so is there really that much between them? The answer to that question is a very large yes and making the wrong play is particularly expensive at this score where a gammon wins the match for Black.<br>
<br>
What is your choice? If you chose (a) then give yourself a pat on the back. After this play, if White misses the shot, then Black’s extended jeopardy only arises if White fans with 33, 22 or 23. After (b) if White misses the shot then there is considerable extended jeopardy for Black.<br>
<br>
He will have five checkers left on the board so he is likely to leave at least one more shot and the nightmare scenario arises when he takes two checkers next turn and then rolls a ‘1’ on his subsequent turn, giving White the chance to execute a ’coup classique’. As you can see (b) limits the extended jeopardy to negligible levels while (a) leaves Black with a lot of work to do. <br>
<br>
In a money game (b) is merely a blunder. At this match score the efficiency of Black’s gammons magnifies the single blunder into a 3.5 blunder, once again demonstrating how important the match score is when making decisions. Normally it is doubling cube mistakes that gives us blunders of this magnitude but this position clearly demonstrates that checker play errors can be equally ruinous.<br>
<br>
Ray actually chose the wrong play and I then hit his blot by rolling 42. He replied with 25 from the bar hitting two checkers. There was further excitement after that and still time for me to make a bad checker play error before Ray won his gammon and the match.<br>
<br>
Analysed in the cold light of day 3/off, 2/1* is clear but always remember that over the board such decisions are not that easy except for the very best players who would simply ‘know’ that 3/off, 2/1* was correct.<br>
