 <div class="description">Like nearly all ancient games backgammon is a representation of war. In this particular war each army has fifteen soldiers. With such a small number of soldiers it is important that they all play their part in the battles. If you fight with fourteen men against fifteen, assuming equal skill levels, the larger force will prevail in the end.<br>
<br>
Occasionally you have no choice other than to put a third checker on your ace-point but you have to recognise that checker will play no useful part in the rest of the game and is effectively dead. Even a third checker on the 2-pt when you have an open ace-point is to be avoided. The checker can only usefully go the ace-point and so has limited options. That third checker is known as a ‘dilly’ builder.<br>
<br>
You should always strive to keep all of your checkers (soldiers) in play as long as possible.  As an example, let us look at this position sent to me by Leo Waters. Black has double threes to play. <br>
<br>
After the forced bar/22 it is clear that one of the outside points must be moved. As Black wants to maintain maximum pressure on both of White’s outer board points it is obvious that 13/10(2) is correct. This maintains the pressure but also gives Black some playability for his next turn when, if necessary, he will dismantle the 10-pt he has just made.<br>
<br>
The key is in the last three. Many would play 5/2, limiting the inner point blots to one, at a time when Black is about to possibly get a shot. However, 5/2 creates the dilly builder we have just discussed and which is to be avoided. The correct play by a huge margin is 4/1, despite the two inner board blots,<br>
<br>
The checkers on the 10-pt will be used to remake the 5-pt and 4-pt and a 1 next turn can be used to tidy up the blots by remaking the 4-pt. Thus, all the soldiers are still active parts of the army. In XG terms playing 5/2 with the fourth three is very nearly a blunder. <br>
<br>
If you try out both plays by moving the checkers then you quickly realise how ugly bar/22, 13/10(2), 5/2 looks in comparison to bar/22, 13/10(2), 4/1. Sometimes aesthetics can help to guide you to the right play. Meanwhile, keep those soldiers on the field of battle!<br>
