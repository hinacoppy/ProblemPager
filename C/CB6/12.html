 <div class="description">The last article left us with two questions: a) with Red trailing 3-5 in a match to 11 what are the correct cube actions and (b) if the cube was centred on 1 what are the right cube actions?<br>
<br>
Let’s start with (b). Red has a strong position because of his 5-pt prime and the fact that White’s rear checker is not at the edge of the prime. The race is close. On the down side for Red he has two rear checkers and all of White’s checkers, other then the two on his 2-pt, are well positioned.<br>
<br>
Red could lose his market by his next turn so he should definitely be doubling. Equally well White has plenty of counter chances and there is a lot of play still in the position. The correct answers are double for Red, comfortable take for White.<br>
<br>
Now (a): in a money game the size of the cube would be irrelevant but in match play it is all important. If Red redoubles to 4 then his gammons are perfectly efficient as he would then win the match 11-5 and not a point would be wasted. <br>
<br>
Red will win a gammon about 15% of the time from here and that fact turns the position into a very clear drop. In fact taking would be a blunder!<br>
<br>
Martin Birkhan and I certainly didn’t pick up all these points while we were commentating in live play. It was only when we studied the position afterwards that the complexities became apparent.<br>
<br>
The position is an object lesson in just how much you need to study to become a strong tournament player.<br>
