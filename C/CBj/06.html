 <div class="description">Early next month I will be giving a seminar at the Cotswold Backgammon Tournament entitled “How Difficult is Backgammon?”. I am not sure I will be able to provide a definitive answer but I will be looking at various aspects of complexity and also at how to interpret Performance Ratings (PR).<br>
<br>
Every player has two PRs, one for checker play and one for cube handling. I doubt there is a player in the world who has a cube PR lower than his checker play PR. Ninety years after its invention doubling continues to flummox us and the more you play the more you realise just how difficult handling the cube can be.  <br>
<br>
Paul Magriel’s famous statement: ‘Good checker play will never compensate for serious errors of judgement in doubling’ is as true today as when he first wrote it forty years ago. Good cube handling requires hours of study, a vast library of reference positions and the ability to perform some serious mental arithmetic, particularly in match play. <br>
<br>
Today’s position nicely demonstrates some of the key elements of doubling. White is playing a 2-4 back game with tenuous timing. The general rule of thumb for doubling back games is to do so when you have cleared the fourth highest point in front of the defender’s highest anchor. Here White owns the 4-pt and so in theory Black should not double until he has cleared his 8-pt.<br>
<br>
However, as noted above, White is running out of time and, in order to preserve his home board, he will probably soon have to run a checker from Black’s 4-pt. Rolls like double threes and double fours are immediately ruinous for him. This lack of timing means that Black should double now as he may have lost his market by his next turn. <br>
<br>
In the given position White has a borderline take/pass. The fun comes when you move White’s outfield checker around. Put it on White’s bar-point and the position becomes a massive pass. Put it on Black’s 9-pt and the position is only just a double. The crucial factor is the number of pips White has to play with before he has to give up his 4-pt anchor.<br>
<br>
We are not finished yet. How about moving a checker from Black’s 6-pt to his 1-pt giving him fewer spare pips to play with. Does that affect the outcome? It certainly does. Now it is the double that is in question and the take that has become trivial! Take the two spare checkers from Black’s 6-pt and give him his 1-pt and the position becomes a huge no double.<br>
<br>
This is the way to build a library of reference positions. The original position provides a benchmark against which future positions can be measured. By playing around with the initial position we learn which factors can influence the doubling decisions. <br>
<br>
I’ll let you move the two spare checkers on Black’s 6-pt to give him either his 9-pt or his 10-pt and then you can see how that influences the results.<br>
