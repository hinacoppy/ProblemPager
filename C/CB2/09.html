<br>
Preparations for the Halloween Ball were well under way at Harbinger Hall. A veritable plethora of pumpkins could be seen wherever one looked. Witches on broomsticks were also in plentiful supply as the great hall was decorated.<br>
<br>
The preparations went largely unnoticed in the library where the usual suspects were gathered around the backgammon board as the afternoon chouette continued apace. Quentin Quickcube held the box as White. The team captain was Barry Bigplay.<br>
<br>
When this 54 landed on the board BB was quick to speak. <br>
<br>
“We are well ahead in the race and this roll puts us 28 pips ahead. 20/11 looks as plain as a pikestaff to me. Anybody else have a different idea?”<br>
<br>
“Are you sure about giving up the anchor, BB?”, enquired Cautious Cuthbert. “QQ does have twelve checkers in the attack zone. Isn’t that rather too many? What about playing 11/2? Surely one dead checker cannot hurt us that much?”<br>
<br>
“Your natural caution will be the death of us, CC’ said the Dowager Duchess, finally entering the debate. “BB’s play has merit but perhaps we should just release the mid-point with either 13/9, 13/8 or perhaps even 13/4 which I notice rather cleverly duplicates ones? I am sure Paul Magriel would like that play. You have been very quiet, EE. Which of the four plays do you like, and please don’t say CC’s 11/2!”<br>
<br>
While the others had been speaking the Enigmatic Englishman had been studying the position intently and only now did he venture to speak.<br>
<br>
“As usual you have all suggested moves without explaining how they tie in to any form of strategy. How many times have I explained that any move must play to a plan, whether that plan be straightforward or not.<br>
<br>
“Of course, we want to run the back checkers but hours of study have taught me that the majority players relinquish their anchors far too soon. CC is right in one respect and that is to examine the number of QQ’s checkers in the attack zone. Twelve is, as he surmises, too many. What then should our plan? It is two-fold. We want to strengthen our own home board before we start to run and ideally, we would like QQ’s position to advance somewhat to make it easier for us leap with both our rear checkers.”<br>
<br>
“And how do you propose we do that?”, asked BB.<br>
<br>
“We can dismiss CC’s 11/2 which weakens rather than strengthens our position. We have discounted BB’s 20/11 as too dangerous. Of DD’s two play 13/9, 13/8 is the weaker as it destroys our connectivity and lets  QQ hit and run with any six. Any such hit leaves us with few return shots. 13/4 is better as it maintains some connectivity and generates more return shots.”<br>
<br>
“So, 13/4 must be the play,” said DD.” I knew I was finally getting the hang of the game, Excellent!”<br>
<br>
“So very nearly, my dear DD’, replied EE. “We have yet to discuss the merit of one more play, namely 11/6, 8/4.”<br>
<br>
“A double direct shot? Are you mad, EE?” remarked CC.<br>
<br>
“Far from it, CC. Once you see the play it becomes obvious. Consider: it starts to strengthen our home board; it maintains the mid-point and thus it also maintains our connectivity; it takes tactical advantage of the blot on QQ’s 3-pt because of the duplication of fives and finally, assuming QQ doesn’t hit both blots, we will get a lot of return shots if QQ elects to hit.”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord, EE, how do you see so much in a single position”, asked DD.<br>
<br>
“Because while you talked, I analysed. Whatever you may think backgammon is a very, very difficult game to play well and sometimes only deep analysis will reveal the correct play. That is the case here.”<br>
<br>
“I am convinced, 11/6, 8/4 it is”, said BB.<br>
<br>
“Personally, I am exhausted after so much analysis”, Said DD. “Graves, kindly bring me a strong whisky and soda.”<br>
<br>
“Certainly, madam”, replied that most eminent of butlers.<br>
