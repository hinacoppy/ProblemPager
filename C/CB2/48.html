 <div class="description">In the history of backgammon there have only been four books written that have been dedicated solely to the topic of doubling. Two of those, “Backgammon Winning with Doubling Cube” by Peter Bell and “Advanced Cube Strategy” by Gaby Horowitz and Bruce Roman, are riddled with errors and misconceptions and should not really be in anybody’s backgammon library. <br>
<br>
The other two are “The Doubling Cube Volume 1” by Jeff Ward, which stands the test of time but has long been out of print, and “The Backgammon Encyclopedia Volume 1 by Kit Woolsey. Woolsey’s book is excellent but the proofs have been lost so it too is currently unavailable unless you can find one second-hand.<br>
<br>
The good news is that there is now a fifth book as The Gammon Press have just published Woolsey’s “The Backgammon Encyclopedia Volume 2”.  The format of the book is the same as Volume 1. Woolsey takes a scenario such as priming and starts with a base position for which he establishes the correct cube action. He then varies the position to judge the impact of changing various different elements. In this way the reader can begin to understand what is important in any given position type and learns how to think correctly about the cube action.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is taken from the excellent chapter on Containment. Sadly for the student each of the variables has an influence on the cube handling. Those variables are:<br>
<br>
•	Number of White checkers borne off<br>
•	The strength of White’s home board<br>
•	The length and position of Black’s prime<br>
•	Number of Black builders in position to make the next point in the prime<br>
•	The position of the contained checker<br>
<br>
In the position shown Black not quite strong enough to redouble although it is very close. If White had only borne off one checker rather than two then Black would have a marginal redouble. Getting such positions right over the board is very difficult but studying such positions in a structured manner is a key method for improving one’s over the board performance.<br>
<br>
Like all backgammon books Volume 2 of the Encyclopedia will never be a best-seller but, for those prepared to put in the hours of study, it will certainly help to improve their decision making in difficult situations. I have always been a firm believer in Malcolm Gladwell’s “10,000 Hours” concept.  That is, to become world-class at anything you need to put in 10,000 hours of study, practice and play. Reading Volume 2 should be part of everybody’s 10,000 hours.<br>
