 <div class="description">I had just fanned (as White) against Black’s four-point home board. My opponent, seeing two opposing checkers on the bar, swiftly doubled. I am not sure whether he was expecting me to pass but he looked disappointed when I accepted the double.<br>
<br>
He rolled a poor 53 and it wasn’t long before I was safely anchored on his 5-pt and offering him a redouble he could not accept. Was Black unlucky or was his double incorrect?<br>
<br>
Those who have read my blog for the last year will know I have constantly returned to the theme of broken primes. Ever since I studied Michy handling a complex position against Gaz Owen which involved broken a prime I have spent some considerable time collecting and analysing broken prime positions.<br>
<br>
Here White has a classic broken prime and, importantly, no weaknesses other than his two checkers on the bar. Meanwhile, Black does not have much in which to escape his two rear checkers, as evidenced by the game continuation. To escape he must reach the hole in the broken prime and then leap the second part of the prime. <br>
<br>
In fact he has so little time here to do so that his double is premature, and it is an error but not a blunder. Giving your opponent ownership of the cube in this position is not a good idea. Black needs to make some improvement to his position before he can offer the cube.<br>
<br>
However, backgammon is a game of small margins and if you move one of the Black checkers on White’s ace-point to White’s 2-pt, giving Black useful threes, then he has a strong double but White still has an easy take.<br>
<br>
The position can also create some interesting checker play conundrums. After double/take how would you play 31 as Black: (a) 8/5, 6/5 or (b) 24/20?<br>
<br>
Actually, whichever play you chose is OK! The two plays, with their differing game plans, virtually dead-heat in the rollout with (a) just fractionally ahead.<br>
