Firstly my thanks to those who have been brave enough to add their comments to this position and others - please keep writing as it adds great value to the site.<br>
<br>
When Danny sent this to me I wondered why, as it seemed a trivial problem. Indeed, for money it is trivial and there is virtually no difference between 7/1, 6/4 and 7/1, 5/3. This is because the game will in all likelihood very shortly end with a cube turn.<br>
<br>
At the match score it is not nearly so trivial because if White hits the shot that Red leaves and Red fans White will be too good to double most of the time and will be playing for a gammon. Winning a gammon is very important for White because he will then be 2-1 ahead at the Crawford Game â€“ very different from the score being tied at 1-1.<br>
<br>
Now 7/1, 5/3 is much better than 7/1, 6/4 because: it reduces the number of shots from 12 to 11; when White hits with a 1 (except 11) he will still need a 6 (or 15) to leap Red's prime. This may force him to cash the game in some variations.<br>
<br>
The equity difference is 0.06 which is much larger than I would have expected and demonstrates once again just how complex backgammon can be and how much a live cube can affect a checker play decision. Until you think about the implications of the match score you don't get close to solving this problem.<br>
