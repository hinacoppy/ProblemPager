One of my favourite sporting quotes comes from the multiple gold medal winning oarsman, Matthew Pinsent: “Lack of skill, discipline or fitness are common amongst all but the top sportspeople. Once you get to the top it is pressure, the influence of the opposition or mental toughness.”<br>
<br>
That comment applies as much to mind games as it does to sport. We can all solve problems much more easily from the comfort of an armchair. There is no real pressure to get the correct answer and, if you get the wrong answer, there is no real penalty other than the annoyance of failing to solve the puzzle.<br>
<br>
Back in the environment of a live tournament things are very different. Pressure comes from many aspects: the need to win to progress; the loss of potential winnings; a large audience watching your every move and finally, the clock will be ticking away the seconds.<br>
<br>
In a recent tournament world number one, Mochy, was Black and trailed 5-6 in a match to 11. His opponent redoubled him to 4 and the pressure was well and truly on. White has twenty-seven rolls that make a five-point prime when Black’s position will become precarious indeed. Four points will take White to 10-5 and Black will have only 10% match winning chances from there.  Seeing all this and knowing his opponent to be weaker than himself (when you are world number one this happens a lot!) Mochy dropped the redouble and played on from 5-8 behind.<br>
<br>
In this instance Mochy allowed to pressure to get the better of his judgement. Analysed in the calm of a study I am sure he would have reached the correct conclusion that this is only just a redouble and a surprisingly easy take. Black is ahead in the race, has (at least for the moment) the stronger home board and has threats of his own against White’s rear checker. Attacking that checker may give him time to extricate his own rear checker.<br>
<br>
If you add in the factor that Black will be very quick to redouble to 8 and put the match on the line then you can see how easy the take is. The problem is that under pressure the mind often only sees the negative aspects of a position and influences decisions accordingly.<br>
<br>
In a money game the redouble would be much clearer because White doesn’t have to worry about the influence of the score. Equally well I am sure that in a money game Mochy would have made the correct decision.<br>
<br>
So even the best in the world can succumb to pressure as many great sportspeople and games players the world over have shown. But then, that’s what makes top level sports and games so exciting to watch.<br>
