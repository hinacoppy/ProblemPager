If you wait long enough backgammon positions do repeat.<br>
<br>
Nearly thirty years ago in the first ever World Cup Final Joe Sylvester (Black), at that time the strongest player in the world, trailed Ray Glazer (White) 15-23 in a match to 41 points (time was not a pressing issue in 1988!) when this position arose. Sylvester studied and analysed for eight minutes before redoubling to 8, much to the surprise of the crowd. <br>
<br>
Sylvester rolled a non-double, Glazer rolled 43, both sides then rolled non-doubles, Joe had won 8 points and the match was tied at 23-23. From there Joe moved steadily ahead and won the match 41-31. After this game the players took a break and Joe arrived breathlessly at the commentary position to explain that while he would not redouble in a money game it was correct to double at this match score because Glazer could never redouble. Was he correct?<br>
<br>
On one thing they were all agreed, if this was a money game this was no double because of the huge redouble vigorish that White has in the sequences where Black does not roll a double and then White bears off two men. Having decided this, the consensus of opinion on the question posed above was that Black should wait and redouble White out if he rolled a 1 or a 3 (except 33 of course, after 11 White still has a take).<br>
<br>
In an article “Backgammon – An Independent View”, written long ago, I analysed the match position and determined that Sylvester was both correct to redouble and in analysing that Glazer should not redouble in the scenario outlined above.<br>
<br>
Moving on the present day I was watching a late-night match on GridGammon when this identical position occurred in a money game. Coincidentally the cube was once more on 4. Black paused for about two seconds before rolling. He rolled a non-double, his opponent rolled 31 and Black then cashed his four points. Should he have redoubled? This is easy to solve with modern technology. Both XG and Sconyers’ bear-off database give this as a clear redouble. It is an error but not a blunder to hold on to the cube.<br>
<br>
So, Sylvester was wrong about the money game action in 1988 and the modern-day player also failed to redouble. Why does nobody get this right?  I think it comes down to too much analysis being subjective, rather than objective, plus a little bit of fear of staring down the barrel of a 16 cube! Having got the result from Sconyers I did a little objective analysis.<br>
<br>
Firstly, how often will Black lose his market in the original position? There are two possibilities: he rolls a set of doubles and White doesn’t roll 44 or better, or he rolls a non-set and White rolls a 1 or a 3 (except 33). 11 can be viewed as a market loser as it is right on the borderline of pass/take. This happens a whopping 59% of the time. Definitely volatile! Definitely a good time to double. <br>
<br>
Secondly, how often will White redouble? This now requires a triple parlay. Black doesn’t roll a set, White rolls one of the 13 numbers (54, 45, 64, 46, 65, 56, 42, 24, 52, 25, 62, 26, 22) which leave him with two checkers, Black doesn’t roll a set. This works out to 25%. It is great for White when it happens but it only happens a quarter of the time.<br>
<br>
Having removed the emotion it becomes clear why this is a redouble - Black loses his market far too often to be able to afford to wait. The moral here is that you don’t have to wait until you can see the whites of your opponent’s eyes before you redouble - too often you wait too long and you lose equity because of the fear of a parlay such as that described above. So, think objectively, not subjectively. <br>
<br>
A little objective analysis in the eight minutes available to the commentary team in 1988 might have produced the right answer at the time, but somehow I doubt it. We are used to using computers to help solve problems like this and then we learn for the analysis. That technique was not available in 1988 and the commentators were trapped in the type of thinking that predominated in that era.<br>
<br>
Never forget how much the game has changed since the advent of neural net computers.<br>
