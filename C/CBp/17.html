<div class="description"><hr>
American teacher Phil Simborg posted this position on Facebook this week. Black is on roll. Should he double and if doubled should White take?<br>
<br>
With a lead of forty-one pips in a short race of course Black must double. The question is the take. Phil showed this to a number of people including three well-known giants of the game. They all dropped and that was my immediate assessment as well. White gets immediate double shots after Black's 62, 63 and 52 but surely that doesn't compensate for the forty-one pips racing deficit?<br>
<br>
This is an unusual position insomuch that you are unlikely to have seen something like it before. When the unusual occurs you need to spend more time studying the position to stop yourself just making a snap judgement based on your prior experience, because it is too easy to apply general principles and come to the wrong conclusion.<br>
<br>
That is the case here where a deeper analysis leads one to a very different conclusion.<br>
<br>
In addition to the shots generated after Black's 62, 63 and 52 White can leave his rearmost checker on Black's 4-pt for a while and that may generate more shots as Black has very few spare 2's to play before he has to play 6/4*. <br>
<br>
Secondly Black's bear-off structure is hugely inefficient with those gaps on the 3-, 4- and 5-pts. The normal flat position (two checkers on all the home board points) creates 10 pips of wastage. That means that to bear off from the flat position which has 42 pips, on average Black will have to roll 52 pips. In this position Black has something between 17 and 20 pips of wastage.<br>
<br>
That means that White has real racing chances. One big double from White and he is right back in the race. The combination of chances from immediate shots, later shots and the race actually give White a trivial take of Black's double. Black still has a big double, of course, but perhaps surprisingly it is worse than a double blunder to drop as White. <br>
<br>
The kay with such positions is firstly to do the analysis to come to the right conclusion and then to remember it so that the next time a similar position arises the correct decision can be made more easily. This method is basically how we all improve at backgammon. You come across something new, do the analysis, file away the results and then re-use that analysis on future occasions. Sadly, we have imperfect memories so sometimes we learn and subsequently forget, and it is not until we make the same mistake again that the learning is truly reinforced! <br>
<br>
My thanks to Phil for posting such an instructive position.<br>
