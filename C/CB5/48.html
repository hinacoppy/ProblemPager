 <div class="description">Those of you have played chess will know that the most difficult type of sacrifice to find is the one where you place a piece en prise (where it can be captured) on an empty square. This week’s position is the backgammon equivalent of chess’s empty square sacrifice.<br>
<br>
Black is in trouble in this position where White is ahead in race, threat and position, particularly after Black’s roll of 53 which really doesn't do him any favours. The automatic play is 13/10, 13/8. The problem with that move is that it puts no pressure whatsoever on White. Coupled with that, the play concedes control of the outer boards to White. Is there anything better?<br>
<br>
Black could try 13/10, 6/1* but that leaves threes blots and still cedes control of the outer boards. The correct play is the empty square sacrifice, 8/5, 6/1*! , voluntarily slotting the open 5-pt in the hope that the blot can be covered next turn. This move attempts a blitz (note White’s second loose checker on Black’s 11-pt) but it could also lead to Black forming a prime against White’s rear checker(s). Additionally in this variation, Black keeps his mid-point so that his rear checkers are not totally abandoned to their fate.<br>
<br>
I first saw this idea discussed in Marty Storer’s excellent book, “Backgammon Praxis”. The idea must have stuck because I managed to find this play over the board. I was rewarded when my opponent fanned with 63 and I won with a redouble a few moves later.<br>
<br>
Once you have learnt the technique it can be reuse, as happened with myself. I am not sure I would have found the play without having read about the idea in Marty’s book. You have now been introduced to the concept so hopefully one day you can make use of it in your own games.<br>
