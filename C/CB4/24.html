 <div class="description">A couple of weeks ago I looked at how well we play over the first three moves of a game and discovered there were fundamental errors being made, even very early in the game.<br>
<br>
I would have thought that most players would be able to play their second moves correctly but sadly even here I find that bad errors are being made. The first few moves by both players define the future direction of the game and so it is crucial to be able to play accurately in the opening. <br>
<br>
There are about six hundred possibilities for the opening roll and response. By the time we get to the opener’s second roll we are looking at about fifty thousand possible variations so perhaps it is not surprising that so many mistakes are made.<br>
<br>
This week’s position arises after Black opens with 61 (13/7, 9/7) and White responds with 54 (24/20, 13/8). How should Black now play his 43? Over the board my opponent chose 8/5*/1*, putting two checkers on the bar. Sadly for him XG classifies this as a blunder. Why?<br>
<br>
Black’s structure after this play is truly horrible and he has given up his excellent 8-pt for what is likely to be a very short-term gain. In addition, Black’s one-point home board is hardly threatening to White so the possibility of a blitz succeeding is remote.<br>
<br>
Our objectives in the opening are: make new points; unstack the heavy points and mobilise the rear checkers. 8/5*/1* meets none of these objectives.<br>
<br>
Black’s second best move is 24/21, 13/9. This creates triplication of White’s fours and meets two of the objectives outlined above. However, it is still very nearly an error. The best move is to mobilise both rear checkers with 24/20, 24/21. This time there is duplication of fours but Black is really attempting to secure an advanced anchor in White’s board. Unlike 24/21, 13/9 it doesn’t risk losing much ground in the race and, after all, Black is ahead in the race so a racing move is thematic.<br>
<br>
This double split of the rear checkers was popularised by German players in the late 1990s. I have seen it less of late but here it is tactically astute and, most importantly, the best move.<br>
<br>
I cannot stress strongly enough just how important it is to learn these early sequences and the thinking behind the moves. It is a key element on the road to winning backgammon.<br>
