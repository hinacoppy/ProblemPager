 <div class="description">As autumn progressed the nights were drawing in and we had returned to 221B in darkness. Sitting before a roaring fire we quickly warmed up after our perambulations through nearby Regent’s Park. With no case to occupy us Holmes and I once again found ourselves discussing our favourite game.<br>
<br>
“Just how difficult do you think the game of backgammon is, Holmes” I enquired.<br>
<br>
“Like all great games, Watson, it is easy to learn and one can become adept in a matter of months but, as you would expect of a game that has survived five thousand years, the intricacies become ever more complex the more one analyses.”<br>
<br>
“Much like the art of detection, perhaps?”.<br>
<br>
“Indeed so, my dear doctor. An apparently simple case can contain levels of detail not apparent to the casual observer. It is the same with backgammon. Attention to detail is paramount but that must be coupled with a deep understanding of the strategies of the many game types. Let me you give you a simple example from our game last evening.”<br>
<br>
So saying, Holmes set up the board to the position shown above and asked me to reconsider my play of Black’s 61.<br>
<br>
“As I recall, Holmes, I played 8/1 so that if White ran with one his rear checkers I could attack without worrying about the blot on my ace-point.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, you did Watson, but that was muddied thinking. You had your priorities wrong. I was not likely to cede my anchor for a few rolls but meanwhile you should have given more thought so clearing your outside points.”<br>
<br>
“Consider the following: your play risks a blot on an immediate double 6. Moreover, you want to clear those outside points as soon as you can. Ideally you will clear the 8-pt first but, if the dice dictate, then the bar-point could be cleared first.<br>
<br>
“Your play of 8/1 precludes the clearing of the bar-point next turn unless you roll doubles. With the correct play of 8/2, 7/6 you no longer leave a blot with double six and you are ready to clear either outside point. As an example, see how 54 plays after your 8/1 compared with my choice of 8/2, 7/6.”<br>
<br>
“Good Lord, Holmes. You see so much more than I do in what is an apparently simple position. I had but one idea. I see now that you must not only consider different elements of strategy but also keep a sharp eye out for tactical opportunities.”<br>
<br>
“I suspect the game will continue to confound all but the very best for many centuries to come’, concluded Holme and, so saying, reached for his meerschaum and his tobacco slipper.<br>
