Nice though it would be to build the home board the priority here is an advanced anchor. The correct anchor is the bar-point, holding White’s four checkers on his mid-point. Making the 4-pt anchor is too committal and gives White space to play behind Red – not something you want to do when you trail in the race.<br>
<br>
Therefore bar/22, 24/18 is logical and the final 3 should be played 8/5, starting the most important point in the home board.<br>
<br>
The key here is getting the priorities correct, anchor and then home board in that order and not the other way around. Bar/22, 24/18, 8/5 also leaves open the possibility of making the 22-pt at a future point in time – should that be appropriate.<br>
<br>
Note: Thanks to Sue for her comment. I played in the second 16-player British Masters tournament a couple of weeks ago which was the strongest tournament I have ever played in. Over six matches I had an average PR of 4.45 which was good enough for 7th! Mochy was first on 2.97 with Michy second on 3.08. However, Michy won all six of his matches and thus won the tournament. Note to self – must do better!<br>
<br>
As I have all 48 matches there will be plenty of positions from the tournament over the coming weeks once I have done some analysis.<br>
