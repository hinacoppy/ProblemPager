This article appeared in Saturday's Independent in tribute to Barry who died on 7th June.<br>
<br>
Barry ‘Bigplay’ McAdam<br>
<br>
It is with great sadness that I report the passing of Barry ‘Bigplay’ McAdam. Barry was a backgammon and golf friend for over 35 years and was a very well known figure on the UK and European backgammon circuits. For many years we travelled to backgammon tournaments together and nearly always found time for a round or two of golf as well.<br>
<br>
In Danny Kleinman's books Barry Bigplay is one of his cast of fictitious characters. As Barry epitomised BB in real life he quickly took on that name in our London chouettes and that is why BB figures in my own writings.<br>
<br>
The pinnacle of his career was winning the 1989 European Open in Deauville. Joe Sylvester, probably the strongest player in the world at the time, described his backgammon as fearless but to win a major tournament you nearly always need a piece of luck. <br>
<br>
For Barry that came in his semi-final where he was White in this week’s position. It occurred at Double Match Point. On the previous turn his opponent had rolled 22, played 11/3.  He promptly rolled 22 again and had to play 6/4(2), 5/1. Barry rolled 62 (bar/19, 13/11*). The rest, as they say, is history!<br>
<br>
Barry was a true gentleman over the board. Whether winning or losing large sums of money he would remain phlegmatic and the largest reaction you were likely to get from him was a raised eyebrow.<br>
<br>
In the real world BB is no more but he will continue to play on in my chouette until I stop writing. I will miss him. RIP old friend.<br>
