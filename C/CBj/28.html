<div class="description"><hr>
With eight checkers back and his army cut in two you could be forgiven for thinking that White was in trouble in this week’s position. In fact his position is fine because he won’t have any trouble in recirculating his checkers and using them to strengthen his home board. His 59-pip deficit in the race means that he has good timing for his 4-5 back game and it might improve considerably if he can make Black’s 3-pt and eventually transpose into a 3-4 back game. In a perfect world White would get a checker hit, make Black’s 2-pt and transpose into a 2-3 back game.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Black leads in the race but other than the 11-pt he has not managed to build any useful points. Those stacks of checkers on his 8pt and 6-pt are ugly because they are not working for a living. Playing relatively safely with 11/2* or 18/13, 6/2* should be the last thing on his mind.<br>
<br>
Black needs to counter White’s intended game plan. That means narrowing the gap in the race to jeopardise White’s timing for a back game and also preventing, as far as possible, White’s opportunities for making a deeper anchor in Black’s home board.<br>
<br>
Having established the game plans for both sides it should be very clear how Black should play this roll of 54. The only move that plays precisely to Black’s game plan is 8/3*, 6/2*. This move unstacks Black’s two heavy stacks of checkers and destroys White’s two potential anchors. If either of Black’s two blots is hit it can easily be recirculated and be used (hopefully) to make new points in Black’s outer board. At the same time Black’s racing lead will be reduced.<br>
<br>
Even if White’s two checkers on his 2-pt were on his 4-pt, giving him a much stronger home board, Black’s play of his 54 should be exactly the same. Far too often you see the player of the Black checkers in such positions proceed with far too much caution and then they seem surprised when their opponent gets a very well-timed back game and goes on to win the game.<br>
<br>
Defending back games is far better understood than it was twenty years ago but understanding is one thing – executing the correct game plan over the board is another.  Did you find the correct play of Black’s 54?<br>
