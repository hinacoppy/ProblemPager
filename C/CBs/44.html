 <div class="description">If you watch beginners play backgammon everything happens very slowly. That is because everything is new to them and they do not have a mental model of the game imprinted on their memory. When making decisions they do not have prior knowledge of similar positions to draw upon and thus they have to try to work things out from first principles.<br>
<br>
This phase does not last long as they quickly build a library of reference positions and their speed of play increases. So, for example, when rolling a 63 in response to an opening 54 played 24/20, 13/8 they will quickly “learn” that 13/7, 8/5* is the correct move and next time they have the same position they will automatically play the right move without having to think. <br>
<br>
I call such plays ‘bread and butter’ moves, i.e. they form some of the fundamental basics of everybody’s game and speed up play. However, problems can arise when you learn the wrong concepts and make ‘bread and butter’ plays that are, in fact, incorrect. You are likely to repeat the errors unless somebody adjusts your thinking.<br>
<br>
This week’s position is a good example of someone making an error without knowing it. Faced with this 42 Black elected to keep his racing lead by moving 8/4, 6/4. This is fine for one move but Black must look ahead. 8/4, 6/4 puts two checkers behind White’s anchor and also gives him four stripped points in his outer board, meaning he could have difficulty playing future moves safely.<br>
<br>
If Black is lucky a better player will point out to him the advantages of playing 13/7.  This move gives Black a healthy stack of builders on his 6-, 7- and 8-points; it starts to dismantle a point that he may have trouble clearing later. The blot that is left on the mid-point is not in much danger. White will be loath to give up his own mid-point to hit and he may well not hit unless he can cover the blot on his 4-pt at the same time.<br>
<br>
After playing 13/7, Black should now have plenty of timing and hopefully he will roll a big double to bring the checkers on White’s bar-point to safety. Of course, this is backgammon, so nothing is guaranteed but 13/7 is the play that best meets the demand of the position.<br>
<br>
Once Black has learnt the concepts behind the play then hopefully he will be able to use the same technique in future positions and it can become one of his ‘bread and butter’ moves.<br>
