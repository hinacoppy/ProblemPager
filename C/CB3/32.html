 <div class="description">For money, this would be a huge double but still a comfortable take -  White has many ways to win but Red must activate the gammon threat by cubing.<br>
<br>
At the match score Red must be more circumspect but a key skill in match-play backgammon is knowing when to double when leading. Here two points get Red to the Crawford Game with his opponent on an odd number – that should start alarm bells ringing for both players.<br>
<br>
Even if Red can’t clear his rear checker and subsequently gets hit then White still has a lot of work to do to win. Because of the score and power of his redoubles White has an easy take but Red must double – it is a blunder not to do so. If he safely clears his rear checker he will have lost his market by a country mile by his next turn and 5-1 is very different from 6-1 (Crawford).<br>
