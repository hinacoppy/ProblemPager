 <div class="description">In any walk of life it is difficult to improve one's performance without feedback, otherwise how do you know if you are improving? In the world of modern sport we are swamped with statistics on players' performance but some measures are still subjective and of course there is the small matter of who actually wins the game/match!<br>
<br>
Performance evaluation in backgammon before the advent of computers was largely based on results plus the subjective opinions of the accepted masters of the day. Everybody knew Paul Magriel was a great player and likewise Robertie, Goulding etc. but nobody knew how well they had actually played in any particular match.<br>
<br>
Nowadays we know precisely how well anybody has played because we can analyse each and every move with XG or other bots. If someone wins a tournament but is very lucky we know just how lucky he/she has been. The other benefit is that the players receive total feedback and so they can analyse their mistakes and hopefully not make similar errors again.<br>
<br>
The reason a lot of players, myself included, prefer to play a lot of online backgammon is that you can download each and every match, use XG to analyse them, and receive very useful instruction from the results. In this way the learning curve is accelerated and you can improve much more quickly than was the case back in the 1970s and 1980s.<br>
<br>
Most bad blunders are still made with the doubling cube but every so often it is still possible to make very poor checker plays. This week's position is my worst checker play this year. How would you play Black's double twos?<br>
<br>
I decided that my advanced anchor allowed me to make a bold play with the objective of establishing a clear advantage and I opted for the risky 10/8, 7/5, 6/4(2). XG really didn't like this play and in fact any move other than the correct one is at least a blunder â€“ my play was a double blunder.<br>
<br>
The correct move is the very simple 13/7, 10/8. Once shown the right move the key is to work out why it is correct, and then learn from that.  The key point about the position is that after the roll Black already has a distinct advantage and shouldn't overplay the position. He will be 24 pips ahead and already holds an advanced anchor. There is absolutely no need to leave White direct shots.<br>
<br>
Even 13/11, 13/7, which looks to be a reasonable play, leaves White 8 shots that will completely dissipate Black's racing lead and it is still a blunder. The correct strategy is for Black to play this move safely and then see what happens next turn.<br>
<br>
Occasionally one just completely misses a possible play. This type of mistake is annoying but good concentration and not playing too quickly can eliminate most of that type of error. In contrast, the error highlighted in this article is strategic and learning from it will bear rich dividends in the future.<br>
<br>
Before the bot era this type of learning was simply not available. Now that it is we should make use of it as much as we can.<br>
