 <div class="description">Doubling theory in back games is still evolving, largely because the bots now play back games so well. Early versions of the TD-Gammon and JellyFish did not play back games particularly well and even Snowie had its problems.<br>
<br>
Player like Bill Robertie and Kent Goulding did a lot of work in this area while developing and publishing their landmark magazine, “Inside Backgammon”. The early publication years coincided with the emergence of the bots and when computer rollouts replaced hand rollouts back game theory began to evolve quite quickly.<br>
<br>
I think it was Kent Goulding who first postulated that you should double a back game when you have only three more points to clear in front of the defender’s most advanced anchor. For example, if your opponent is playing a 1-3 back game you should not double until you have cleared your own bar-point. This postulate assumes that the defending side has a well-timed game.<br>
<br>
Redoubling in back games is a much murkier area precisely because less work has been done on the topic. There are many factors to be considered: the number of shots; how many checkers (if any) have already been borne off; the state of the defender’s home board/prime and finally how efficiently can the cube be used subsequently by either player.<br>
<br>
There are many positions where even a triple shot for the back game player is insufficient reason to redouble. In this week’s position Black has a mere twenty-three shots at White’s blot on the bar-point. In the game from which this was taken Black rolled 55 and then won with a redouble next turn. The question is: did he miss a redouble before rolling his double fives?<br>
<br>
The answer is yes and in fact not redoubling is a clear blunder. It is a redouble for the following reasons: a hit will nearly certainly result in a winning redouble next turn – Black’s market will have been lost; White has no checkers off (very key) and can still lose a gammon (in fact he does so 17&amp; of the time); White has six dead checkers and a weak home-board position. Finally, even if Red misses, White will not be able to win with an immediate redouble - in fact White cannot consider redoubling for some time to come.<br>
<br>
This position just begins to touch on some of the key elements involved in redoubling in back games. There is a long way to go before we really understand the topic.<br>
