 <div class="description">This is a difficult problem because Red has to come up with the right game plan rather than just looking at the next move.<br>
<br>
With Red’s rear two checkers stuck behind a five-point prime there are two possibilities.<br>
<br>
a) Prime White’s three rear checkers and cause his p&#91;rime to crack <br>
b) Blitz White’s checkers and then escape his own rear checkers.<br>
<br>
A play like 8/5*/1 just won’t work – it isn’t aggressive enough. 9/5*, 8/5 is reasonable but it will be easy for White to play his big numbers – Red needs his 8-pt.<br>
<br>
The correct play is 14/11*, 9/5* which ticks all the boxes. It looks risky because when it goes wrong it can go very wrong but surprisingly Red loses pretty much the same percentage of gammons whichever play he chooses so he might as well go for the play that maximises his winning chances.<br>
<br>
Interestingly the match score has no real effect and 14/11*, 9/5* would be the right play for money as well. <br>
<br>
The bots have taught us make plays like this. in the 1970s virtually nobody would have considered the correct play and even if they had considered it, even fewer would actually have made the play.<br>
