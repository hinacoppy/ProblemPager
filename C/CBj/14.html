<div class="doAction">Match Play. Red trails 2-9 to 11. Should Red double? If doubled, should White take?</div>

 <div class="description">I was Red in this position from the last 16 of the UK Open. After very long thought I doubled. I rolled 21, hitting White's blot. White fanned and my next roll was 63, making my 5-pt. So far so good but then I just couldn't escape my rear checker. I crashed my home board and subsequently lost the game and match.<br>
<br>
Was the double correct? Not it wasn't. In fact it was a triple blunder! My assumption was that if I fanned I would be 10-2 behind with about 4% match winning chances but if I hit I could win a gammon and get to 6-9.<br>
<br>
In fact this was way too optimistic as the game continuation showed - hitting doesn't always win. The crucial point is that after hitting White's blot the cube has great value to Red and can still be used efficiently. This is the point I missed in my analysis and was a very useful lesson for me as I hope it is for you. As a minor point I should also not necessarily discard my 4% winning chances â€“ matches have been won from worse positions.<br>
