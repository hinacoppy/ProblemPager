 <div class="description">Blitzkrieg is defined as an intense military campaign intended to bring about a swift victory. In backgammon, not only does a blitz bring about a swift victory when it succeeds, but it frequently brings the reward of a gammon and double points.<br>
<br>
Before the advent of computers we really did not play blitzes that well, often not being aggressive enough and letting the defending player make an anchor. Once the defender makes an anchor he often has a strong game because the attacking side may have blots strewn around the board that can subsequently be attacked. The likes of JellyFish, Snowie and XG have taught us to be super-aggressive when laying blitzes, often leaving two home board blots to prevent the defender making an anchor. One bad roll by the defender then means that the blitz can be resumed full force.<br>
<br>
Players also now have a much better understanding of doubling tactics in blitzes and, once again, are far more aggressive than they used to be, recognising that four points for a doubled gammon is worth the risk of the occasional loss.<br>
<br>
We start off by learning the blitzes that can occur after the early roll of a double in the opening, typically after the opponent has split his rear checkers and then the attacking side rolls a good double. Everybody should know the correct doubling actions after an opening roll split followed by a good double in response. For example, after the sequence: White 21:  24/23, 13/11 Black 55: 8/3(2), 6/1(2)* White: Fan, what is the correct doubling action for both players? If you don’t know the answer then you should find a copy of Kit Woolsey’s “The Backgammon Encyclopedia -  Volume 1” which looks at all these early game scenarios.<br>
<br>
Once we are out of the opening we need to rely on some guiding principles to make our doubling decisions. The attacking side needs to look at the number of checkers in the attack zone, the strength of the defender’s home board (which may limit the aggression), the number of loose blots and, of course, the race. For the defender he needs to look at the probability of anchoring and where that anchor might be, the quality of his home board (to contain a hit checker) and of course the race.<br>
<br>
I had this week’s position in a match and noted that most of the elements were in my favour. True my opponent has a three-point home board but it is a very poor one and I would have no qualms about being very aggressive with my blitz. White has five blots for me to shoot at. I doubled and was surprised when my opponent took. He paid the price when my blitz succeeded and those five blots were closed out. In fact it is a double blunder to take.<br>
<br>
Note however, that if you move the blot on White’s 9-pt to his 8-pt, giving him his 8-pt and only three blots then the position is only just a double and a trivial take. As ever with backgammon the devil is in the detail. What is really needed is for someone to provide an extensive book of reference positions for blitzes -  any volunteers?<br>
