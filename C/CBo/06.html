 <div class="description">Many of our move selections at backgammon are governed by a set of rules and principles that we learn as we improve at the game and then we apply those rules to new positions as we encounter them in live play. Backgammon is too difficult to analyse each position from scratch and so those general rules enable us to play the game at a reasonable speed and, in the majority of situations, they also enable us to select the correct move.<br>
<br>
The problem as somebody once remarked is that “as a general rule all general rules are wrong”. I am not sure that I wholly agree with that statement but there are nearly always exceptions to every rule and that is particularly true in backgammon where our rules give us an overall framework within which to operate but good players know when a rule should be overlooked because of a specific tactical or even a strategic requirement.<br>
<br>
This week's position ably demonstrates that concept. It is Double Match Point and White has borne off four checkers before being hit. The general rule for placing checkers in your home board when bearing in and when there is still contact says that you should try to keep an even number of checkers on both your highest point and your two highest points combined. This is to avoid leaving shots when rolling high numbers.<br>
<br>
That general rules implies that the correct move here is 10/5 which leaves only two shot leaving numbers next turn, 66 and 55.  10/6, 1/off is far riskier as now 65, 64 and 63 also leave shots, thus quadrupling the chance of exposing a blot so surely 10/5 must be correct?<br>
<br>
The answer is no. There are other factors to take into account: White has already borne off four checkers; White has a speed board and will bear off very quickly once he enters his checker from the bar; the cube is out of play and Black cannot use it to win the game.<br>
<br>
These factors change things significantly and should make Black much more aggressive in bearing off. 10/6, 1/off is the correct move by a long way and 10/5 is a bad error but not a blunder. Only if White has not borne off any checkers is 10/5 the correct play and then only by  a tiny margin.<br>
<br>
The bots have taught us that we must re-examine long held beliefs with regard to the rules by which we play the game. By doing that we refine the rules and produce ones more relevant to the modern game. This week's example has taught us that we must not just blindly follow the 'even checkers' rule but must adjust it to take account of our opponent's structure as well.<br>
<br>
This particular example is not that difficult, but it clearly demonstrates the need to stay constantly alert. I was White in the position and benefited when my opponent played 10/5. I won a very close race by a single checker so he paid a heavy price for playing by rote rather than thinking things through.<br>
