 <div class="description">A student asked me why XG had flagged his play of this 64 as Black as an error.<br>
<br>
He had considered 18/14*/8 but decided three blots were too many against a four-point home board. He therefore chose to go with the ‘safe’ 13/9, 13/7. <br>
<br>
Let’s look at the two plays:<br>
<br>
After 13/9, 13/7 Black will be 10 pips in the race but with White on roll. Unless Black rolls a double fairly quickly he could be forced off White’s bar-point just at the wrong time. Whatever happens the game will go on for some time and Black will be about even money to win.<br>
<br>
After 18/14*/8 the game can get much more exciting. Black will win immediately on White’s nine fanning numbers. White has 17 numbers that hit from the bar (any 2, 11, 44, 16 and 46). Black will have one go at return hitting from the bar himself but if he fans the game will be over. If Black enters and hits again he will probably have the edge. There is the potential for a lot of gammons for both players but the game is likely to end with a cube turn in the next couple of rolls.<br>
<br>
On White’s non-hitting entering rolls (there are 10 of them) Black will be doubling after all of them but White can take after 45 or 15. He must drop after 41, 43 and 13.<br>
<br>
As you can see from this brief analysis Black will be doing much better after hitting than if he makes the passive play.<br>
<br>
My student was very worried about leaving three blots but in fact those blots are protected by the Jacoby Rule and he will never lose a gammon after being hit and fanning. He just saw the danger but didn’t analyse deeply enough to understand the threat was illusory. <br>
<br>
Intermediate players have a habit of looking at things from a negative perspective, seeing only the downside in a position. An expert player would look at this position and immediately see the positives from hitting. Once he had done the brief analysis above he would find the correct play of 18/14*/8.<br>
<br>
Learning to play backgammon well is as much about our attitude to thinking as it is about what we actually think about. The optimist, with his half-full glass, is likely to be a much better player than the pessimist whose glass is forever half-empty.<br>
