<div class="description"><hr>
I doubt Shakespeare had backgammon in mind when he wrote his famous “To be or not to be, that is the question” lines in Hamlet. However, backgammon players constantly have to ask themselves whether the risk is worth the reward when voluntarily leaving a blot, particularly in the endgame where home boards are strong and a hit can be ruinous.<br>
<br>
This week's position is a typical late-game prime versus prime situation. Black has a 54 to play. He can immediate discount 8/3, 7/3 as a candidate play as any six allows White to hit and win the game. The choice is between the completely safe 6/1, 5/1 and the riskier 7/3, 6/1.<br>
<br>
These positions with a home board gap are notoriously difficult to bring home and slotting the 3-pt now with the idea of making it next turn may well prove to be correct. Any hit by White, other than with 11 or 12 will force him to break his own perfect prime. When this sort of position turns up in a chouette there will be strong supporters of the both the safe play and the risky play.<br>
<br>
My rule of thumb in such situations is not to make the risky play if my opponent has a perfect prime but if my opponent has only a five-point prime then the risky play is likely to be correct. <br>
<br>
This position turns out to be on the borderline and hence it is a good reference position. Because eight of White's hits break his own prime the slotting play 7/3, 6/1 turns out to be marginally stronger than the safe play but it is close. <br>
<br>
Put White's spare checker on his 3-pt back on his 8-pt and the risky play becomes a big error.  Put one checker from White's 8-pt onto his 4-pt and the safe play becomes a big error. These are very fine margins but it is important to have a principle by which to make decisions. My one above has stood the test of time. <br>
<br>
Interestingly in the above position both plays win very nearly the same percentage of single games. The difference comes in gammons, both won and lost. The extra gammons won is what really swings the decision in favour of the risky play.<br>
<br>
Now, be honest. Did you even think about the gammon percentages when you started to read this article and analyse the position? If not, don't worry, neither did any of my students to whom I have shown this position. As noted many times before, backgammon really is a very difficult game.<br>
