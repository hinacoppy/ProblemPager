One of the most frequent questions I get asked is: “XG has said my play was a blunder but I don’t understand why its play is necessarily right. Can you please help me?”<br>
<br>
Therein lies one of the problems in improving at backgammon. Knowing why is a move is correct is more important than just knowing what the best move is. If you understand the reasoning you can repeat that logic for future events. If you solve a one-off problem it merely applies to a single instance. You might win the game but your knowledge base is no richer.<br>
<br>
American teacher Phil Simborg posted this position on Facebook earlier this week and expressed sentiments similar to my own above. In the chouette from which it was taken the right play was eventually made with Black’s 63 but did those who disagreed with the play learn from the situation?<br>
<br>
The two choices are 9/3*, 6/3 and 22/13.  One of those plays is a blunder. Take a few moments to make your own choice before reading on.<br>
<br>
The correct play is 22/13. Now let us try to understand why. 9/3*, 6/3 puts White on the bar but Black’s three-point board is unlikely to detain White for long. If he does stay on the bar then there are no further weaknesses for Black to attack. Meanwhile Black still has two checkers stuck behind White’s four-point prime and to add to his problems he now has a blot on his 9-pt.  Prior to hitting he had the makings of a decent prime but now his structure is much weaker.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, 22/13 escapes a rear checker to safety, putting Black marginally ahead in the race. White has ten checkers in the zone to attack Black’s remaining rear checkers but that might mean dismantling his prime. After 22/13 Black has another checker acting as a builder for his improving prime.<br>
<br>
Adding all of this up it is very clear that 22/13 is correct but it is only by examining all the factors that we are able to understand just how strong 22/13 is in comparison to 9/3*, 6/3. This learning can then be applied to future positions that have similar features.<br>
<br>
To extend the learning I looked at how to adjust the position to make hitting the correct play. To do that I initially moved one of White’s checkers from his mid-point to his 10-pt. That weakness is still not enough, 22/13 is still the right play. Then, in addition, I moved the spare checker from White’s 8-pt and put it on his 2-pt. That did it – now running is an error and hitting is correct.  The tactics that come into play because of the two white blots changes the dynamics sufficiently to promote 9/3*, 6/3 to being the correct play.<br>
