 <div class="description">In this week's position Black has a perfectly-timed 2-3 back game. He trails by 92 pips before the roll. As a rough guide you want to be trailing by a number of pips equal to the pips represented by your two back game anchors. Playing a 2-3 back game implies that you should trail by 46+44=90 pips so Black has achieved perfection in that regard.<br>
<br>
With his roll of 21 he has the option of hitting and trying to win by going forwards or he can play something like 11/9, 10/9 and wait for a later shot from his excellent back game. What should he do?<br>
<br>
The simple answer is that he should hit because he then has a two-way game plan. He can win by going forward but he can also fall back on his back game if things go badly. Playing 11/9, 10/9 leaves him with but a single game plan and the multiple version is to be preferred.<br>
<br>
It might seem bold to try to win by going forward but White's position is fragile and could quickly deteriorate and another blot could soon pop loose. White has two checkers out of play on his ace-point and lacks flexibility. An entering roll of 33 after being hit is already awkward for him.<br>
<br>
Having decided to hit which move should Black play? 10/8*/7 is the boldest play, leaving six return shots. 11/8* leaves only four return shots. Is there much difference? On initial evaluation XG says yes, classifying 10/8*/7 as an error and it even prefers 12/11, 10/8* to 10/8*/7.  However, after a long rollout 10/8*/7 is promoted to first place and XG 'sees' the value of building a pure prime.<br>
<br>
The lesson here is by all means try to win by going forward as you can always fall back on your perfectly timed back game. It is also not clear which blocking point Black should be trying to make. Is the 8-pt better than the bar-point - probably not but it is close. I like to build to solid primes and XG agrees with me. but Black must think about how he is going to build his prime to contain White's rear checker. Clearly, he will try to bring his checkers from his 17-pt to the battle as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
This is a complex position with many subtleties and demonstrates the beauty of a well-played back game. Black is already a 57% favourite after 11/8* and owning the cube is very powerful in such positions. He will be itching to redouble to 4 at the appropriate moment and White may well have a difficult decision to make in the not too distant future if things go well for Black.<br>
