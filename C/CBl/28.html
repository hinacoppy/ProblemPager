 <div class="description">This is a difficult position to evaluate over the board. The best way to do it is by using effective pip counts (see the paper on Backgammon Races in the ‘Downloads' section of this website).<br>
<br>
White's EPC is 22 (using the method outlined in the paper). Red's EPC is 17 (his actual pip-count) plus wastage (the number of pips Red will waste bearing off. For example if Red now rolled 66 he would waste 7 pips as he only needs 17 to bear-off). The key is estimating that wastage. In his comment Tim Chow as guessed at 5 which is very reasonable – according to XG it is 5.5.<br>
<br>
In such positions White's point of last take is Red's EPC plus the number of rolls to go minus three (see the Backgammon Races paper for an explanation of this). This is a 3-roll position so White's take point is 22 – (3-3) = 22.<br>
<br>
So if Red's wastage is 5 pips White would have a borderline take. As it is 5.5 White has a comfortable take and this is borne out by XG. Give Red one less pip and the position becomes a pass. Such are the margins in end game bear-offs.<br>
