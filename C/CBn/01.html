 <div class="description">Players get very hung up on their Performance Rating (PR) but PR is purely a measure of technical excellence. If we spent all our time playing against computers then it would be a very accurate measure. However, we play our meaningful backgammon against human beings and human beings are very fallible in all sorts of ways.<br>
<br>
Understanding your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses and then using that understanding to your advantage is a key element to winning in any high-level sport or game. No tennis player would go on court in a major tennis tournament without studying his opponent’s previous matches. That approach is not used so much in backgammon but with resources like Backgammon Studio (www.backgammonstudio.com) now available there is the option to do so.<br>
<br>
Of course, it is more difficult if you do not know your opponent but in the finals of major tournaments quite often you will know your opponent and can do some research. Last year’s World Championship Final is a good example of how the occasion can affect a player. Joe Russell, a very strong player, made a series of small errors in his match with Juergen Granstedt but as the final wore on the errors became more marked and interestingly most of his cube errors were predicted by Falafel, who was commentating. It was not choking in the same class as Jana Novotna versus Steffi Graff in the 1993 Wimbledon Final but it was fascinating to watch.<br>
<br>
You do not always have to make the technically correct play to win games, something that Extreme Gammon would never do! I had this week’s position in a match and my opponent had consistently dropped any position that had even the smallest hint of a gammon. <br>
<br>
I was Black and was reasonably certain that 23/16 was the technically correct play. Black does not have enough checkers in the attack zone to mount a blitz attack. However, I elected to play 8/1*. My reasoning was that if my opponent fanned I would quickly turn the cube and I would expect him to pass despite the fact that it would actually be a trivial take. (I was trailing in the match so the double was correct, for money it wouldn’t even be a double).<br>
<br>
My play was justified when my opponent did stay on the bar and subsequently dropped my double in a matter of seconds.<br>
<br>
This was a fairly simple example but the opportunity for such plays constantly recurs and perhaps even more so in a high stakes chouette where people are playing for more money than they can afford. That, however, is a topic for another day!<br>
