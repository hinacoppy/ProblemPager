<div class="doAction">Match Play. Red trails 4-5 to 7. Should Red double? If doubled, should White take?</div>

 <div class="description">White has just thrown the horrendous root number 44 which was played bar/21*, 6/2(3). From having a reasonable position his game has turned to ashes.<br>
<br>
Those five checkers on the 2-pt mean that he is fighting a battle with a reduced army and as we know, other things being equal, superior forces normally triumph.<br>
<br>
For money this not quite a double although it is closer than you might think. Red’s spare checker on his 3-pt does him no favours and of course the cube is still live.<br>
<br>
At the match score it is a very different story. White’s take point leading 5-4 to 7 is much higher than usual and he must be very wary of gammons. I had this position as Red on Gridgammon and promptly doubled. I won an easy gammon and the match but was I right to double?<br>
<br>
Technically no but not for the reason you might think! XG evaluates this as too good to double/drop and believes Red should play on for an undoubled gammon!<br>
<br>
Psychology is not XG’s strong point and I was certain my opponent (and the vast majority of players) would take. I was proved correct.<br>
<br>
The moral of the story is to beware the 2-away, 3-away score and be careful in accepting doubles when your position is fundamentally compromised.<br>
