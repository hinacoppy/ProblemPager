 <div class="description">This position comes from the Battersea chouette. White had just rolled 61 and had to leave a shot after playing 11/5, 6/5. The box (Black) then pondered for some time but finally doubled all five of the team members.<br>
<br>
In what is a very volatile position the double is perfectly correct and not doubling would be a massive blunder. Black has fourteen hitting numbers and when he hits he will be about even money to win a gammon. There ensued a long discussion between the team which lead to the weakest player present dropping because of the gammon threat.<br>
<br>
Instead of analysing the position calmly three more of the team acted like lemmings by following the first dropper over the cliff and each handed the box a point. Worse was to follow.<br>
<br>
The fifth team member, immune from the lemming principle, analysed calmly and collectively and came to the very reasonable conclusion that position was actually a very comfortable take. In this he was entirely correct. After all, there are 22 numbers where Black doesn't hit, the race is equal and Black has bad numbers of his own as soon as his next turn. The fifth player took.<br>
<br>
There is a rule in the chouette that if only one player takes then he must give the other droppers the option of an 'extra'. This means that each player pays the taker an extra point to accept the cube on 2 -  the idea being that if the position truly is a drop then those who dropped have a chance to get their money back.<br>
<br>
The lemmings compounded their original error by all offering an extra which the fifth play then accepted. He now held five cubes (his own plus the four extras) on two and had already been paid four points. <br>
<br>
The box now rolled one of his worst numbers, 63, which he had to play 18/9. The fifth player was beginning to look good value for his takes! He rolled 64, played 13/7*, 11/7, putting Black on the bar. Black came in immediately with a 41, which he played bar/24, 9/5.<br>
<br>
How it was White's turn to ponder. Holding five cubes on two he took his time but decided his position was strong enough to redouble, which is precisely what he did. XG has this position as a borderline double or no double and an easy take but our fifth player is no shrinking violet and so the cubes came across on four.<br>
<br>
Everybody took and despite Black rolling an early 65 to escape his rear checker he could not catch up in the race and so the lemmings paid a heavy price for dropping the original double. Meanwhile the fifth player calmly banked twenty-four points - five each from the lemmings and four from the Box.<br>
<br>
By sticking to his principles and calmly analysing the position the fifth player was handsomely rewarded for his play. Meanwhile, the lemmings each lost six points - don't forget they had already given the box one point each before erroneously embarking on the extras. An expensive lesson indeed.<br>
