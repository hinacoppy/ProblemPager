 <div class="description">Before he rolled this double four Black had a very well-timed back game. His plan was to keep the 20-pt for as long as possible, then release it and then play a perfectly timed 1-2 back game.<br>
<br>
Does this 44 change things or can he stick to his original game plan? 1-2 back games are notoriously difficult to time because as the opponent bears in his checkers quite often he cannot play fives or sixes and this often slows him up considerably. <br>
<br>
The rule of thumb is that to successfully time a back game you need to trail by a number of pips equal to the value of the two back game anchors. That means for a 1-2 back game you need to trail by a minimum of 94 pips.<br>
<br>
Black was doing all right before this roll but now he will trail by only 77 pips which is not enough to play a 1-2 back game. The likelihood is that his own home board will crash before he hits a shot and it will be impossible to contain any hit checker(s). <br>
<br>
Over the board Black tried 14/6, 8/4, 7/3 but that ugly third checker on his 4-pt should have warned him that he was embarking upon the wrong plan. He should have abandoned his ideas for a 1-2 back game and reverted to a 2-5 back game. Admittedly that is not as good as a 1-2 back game but a well-timed 2-5 game is to be much preferred over a busted 1-2 game.<br>
<br>
He should have played 24/20(2), 14/6 or 24/20(2), 14/10, 7/3. That way, unless he rolls another couple of small doubles his timing should be perfectly OK for his 2-5 back game. Another point to note is that the 2-5 back game loses fewer gammons than the 1-2 back game because it is easier to run the checkers home.<br>
<br>
XG rates 14/6, 8/4, 7/3 as an error (just) and so it is not the worst play ever seen by any means but the key here is to understand when to switch game plans. A big double when playing a back game often predicates a change of plan, in many cases the front anchor has to be abandoned and a simple holding game played instead. In exchange some gammons are saved.<br>
