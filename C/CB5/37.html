 <div class="description">Black had been playing a well-timed 2-4 back game when this double four tumbled out of his dice cup. Noticing that he could put two White checkers on the bar he immediately switched to an attacking game plan and swiftly played 16/12, 15/11*, 8/4(2)*.  <br>
<br>
He failed to contain the two White checkers and ended up with a badly timed back game from which there was no recovery. He lost a single game. So, was Black unlucky or did he misplay his 44?<br>
<br>
Possibly he was unlucky but he definitely misplayed his 44. That roll had the potential to change the game but Black didn’t think deeply enough about his game plan.<br>
<br>
Because he has five checkers still in White’s board he is very unlikely to be able to blitz White and close out his two rear checkers. Black should have recognised that a better game plan was to try to prime those two checkers. An outside prime can be built much easier than a closed home board from the starting position, and the rear checkers can be brought into play more quickly with this game plan.<br>
<br>
Look at the resultant position after 16/12, 15/11*, 13/9(2). Now Black has a four-point broken prime and has the fifth point slotted. That position just looks so much stronger than the one after 16/12, 15/11*, 8/4(2)*. As a bonus for Black,  White’s 44 is now a disaster for him and his 55 doesn’t play very well either. Setting up root numbers for your opponent is all part of the game and highly relevant here.<br>
<br>
It is important to recognize game changing rolls and even more important to take the time to decide upon the right game plan. Here Black was guilty of playing on automatic. Two minutes thought would probably have led him to make the much stronger priming play. XG rates Black’s actual play as a double blunder, showing just how costly selecting the wrong game plan can be.<br>
