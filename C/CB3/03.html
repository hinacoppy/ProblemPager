 <div class="description">The game of backgammon is 5,000 years old, twice as old as any other game in the world. As far as my research goes the far-eastern game of Go is about half as old as backgammon and chess is a mere fledgling as it did not make its debut until 400 AD. Card games do not figure in the longevity stakes as paper did not arrive in Europe until 1000 AD, although the Chinese had it a lot earlier than that. Contract Bridge was invented in 1926 so it is not even a hundred years old.<br>
<br>
It is remarkable that the game has survived for 5,000 years with so few changes. Having said that backgammon may not have survived the 20th Century without the invention of doubling in 1926 which both speeded up the game and made it more exciting. However, even before that I suspect that part of its appeal and a strong contributor to its survival was the huge changes in fortune that can occur in a short space of time. In no other game do such swings of fortune occur so regularly, creating huge adrenalin surges for the players involved.<br>
<br>
Let us look at an example from this year’s World Championship Final between Didier Assaraf (Black) and Petko Konstadinov (White). With the score tied at 9-9 to 19 we join the game with Black on the bar but with the better board and three White blots to shoot at.<br>
<br>
At this point Didier doubled. This is only just a double but you don’t win backgammon matches with timidity.<br>
Peko took and Didier promptly rolled 33, staying on the bar - adrenalin swing number 1. Petko then rolled doubles sixes(!) – adrenalin swing number 2 and leaving Petko feeling pretty good. He misplayed this great roll by moving 23/17*, 13/1*,7/1. Because of Black’s strong home board he should have played 23/17*/11, 13/7(2), giving himself the option of playing a priming rather a blitzing game.<br>
<br>
At this point Didier must have been feeling despondent. Until that is, he produced his next roll, double fours – adrenalin swing number 3. He naturally played bar/21(3), 21/7*.  Petko now managed to produce 53, staying on the bar – adrenalin swing number 4! <br>
<br>
After this series of rolls the excitement died down but Didier had done enough. He went on to win a gammon to take a 13-9 led. He never looked back and in fact, Petko did not score another point in the match. Didier won 19-9, remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament.<br>
<br>
This was undoubtedly the pivotal sequence of rolls in the match and both players did well to exude calmness throughout the whole thing. What they were feeling internally is of course, a completely different question.<br>
<br>
It was great theatre for the spectators, both live and online, and, in my opinion, it is excitement such as this that has helped to maintain backgammon’s appeal over five millennia. Long may<br>
