 <div class="description">Lewis Deyong was the Master of Ceremonies at the Monte Carlo World Championships for many years and he did an excellent job. He is also the author of “Backgammon – Learning to Win” which, as well as being highly entertaining, is also a very instructive book.<br>
<br>
One of the things he talks about in the book is his theory of dice. Basically there are three types: (a) very lucky dice where every number you want arrives promptly; (b) very unlucky dice, the exact opposite of (a) where you just cannot seem to roll anything useful; (c) middle of the road dice where the dice do not particularly favour either player.<br>
<br>
Deyong postulated that with (a) you would win most of the time (assuming roughly equal skill levels) and with (b) you would lose most of the time. It is (c) that separates the expert from the intermediate. If you can play average rolls well then in the long-term you are likely to come out ahead.<br>
<br>
Let us look at this week’s position. This position occurred with Black leading 4-3 to 7. To his opponent’s consternation, he had just doubled. The double is entirely correct, as is the take. Black’s blitzing threat warrants the double and he has 28 numbers that put a second checker on the bar.<br>
<br>
Up until now Black had rolled well but now he managed to produce an absolute lemon – 54 to be precise. The key is not to lose heart or panic when such a roll pops out of the cup but rather to work out how best to play it to your advantage. <br>
<br>
The last thing Black should think of is safety. He has doubled so he needs to make his checkers work for him. This eliminates 21/16, 10/6 as a candidate play – Black does not need a fifth checker on his 6-pt. As Black is ahead in the race 21/16, 20/16 is certainly a reasonable play and it maintains connectivity in Black’s position.  That move is actually the third best play. The second best play is 20/11, bringing the loose checker on the 20-pt to a very useful position where it can contribute to Black’s home board and/or attack White’s blot (assuming White fans).<br>
Perhaps surprisingly the best play of all is the seemingly wide open 20/16, 13/8! That plays puts all the checkers to work and neatly duplicates White 1’s and 3’s. If White hits then Black will have a lot of return shots and if not hit Black’s position will be very strong.<br>
<br>
Problems like this are at the heart of Deyong’s Dice Theory. You have to be good enough to recognise a poor roll for what it is but then have the skill to turn the poor roll into a reasonable one by the way you elect to play it. I’ll wager not many people would find 20/16, 13/8 over the board and even fewer would have the courage the make the move in live play.<br>
