 <div class="description">Sadly it is very easy to play without thinking at backgammon. Over time we learn the patterns of the game and then when we see a position that enables us to use one of those patterns we do so. The key is to ask yourself whether the pattern truly applies to the position in question.<br>
<br>
Black failed the test in this week’s position. When 43 tumbled out of the cup we can at least be grateful that he managed to reject 9/6, 9/5 but it would take a very weak player to make that move!<br>
<br>
He saw that he could make a new inboard point with 6/2, 5/2. He had been taught that home board points are good and he further saw that the 2-pt could be a useful landing point for his checkers as he bore them in.<br>
<br>
What he didn’t do was to look at the demands of the position which is what one should always do first. Black is obviously a strong favourite in the position but as well as just winning the game he should also be seeking to maximize his gammon percentage. <br>
<br>
Once you understand this you then spot those two blots in White’s home board and wonder whether you should take a risk to try to pick them up. The answer is yes. Black should play 5/2, 5/1* exposing two blots in his home board. If either blot is hit Black has the chance to pick up those White blots and if not hit he has forced White forward from his ace-point creating a safe landing point for his own checkers. <br>
<br>
The problem is that we are taught that blots are dangerous in the endgame when both sides normally have strong boards and so we naturally seek safety in the ending. Good players know when an exception to the rule has occurred as is the case here.<br>
<br>
Such is the strength of Black’s position that even if you move the spare checker from White’s 6-pt to give him his 4-pt then 5/2, 5/1* is still the better play although it is now virtually tied with 6/2, 5/2.<br>
<br>
The key is never to stop thinking about your game plan and to be prepared to make adjustments when opportunities present themselves. 5/2, 5/1* may look like bravado but actually it is simply the way for Black to maximize both his game-winning and gammon-winning percentages.<br>
