 <div class="description">Harbinger Hall was bathed in warm sunlight and the gardens looked magnificent as spring had finally arrived after a harsh winter. The morning had been taken up with the traditional Easter egg hunt, much to the satisfaction of the younger members of the house party.<br>
<br>
With the formalities of the hunt concluded the usual suspects adjourned to the library for the Easter chouette. Quentin Quickcube, who was well ahead on the scoresheet, held the box as White. For once the game had not gone well for him and he was in danger of losing a gammon. We join the protagonists as they debate how to play the team’s 54.<br>
<br>
“A magnificent opportunity for a really big play”, said Barry Bigplay. “I think 11/2* must be the move. Don’t give QQ the chance to anchor on our 2-pt. Do you all agree?”.<br>
<br>
“You must be joking”, said Cautious Cuthbert. “We should simply play 11/6, 5/1. Why take risks when we don’t need to?”<br>
<br>
“One day, you will take a risk, CC, and we will all step back in amazement”, said the Dowager Duchess. “I rather like 11/7, 6/1 so that our fives cover our blot and our fours and sixes escape from QQ’s board. What do you think, EE?”<br>
<br>
The Enigmatic Englishman was chatting to Graves, who had been dispensing Bloody Mary’s to the combatants. However, EE now turned his attention to the game and gave his opinion.<br>
<br>
“Firstly, although I like aggression in a backgammon player. BB’s hitting play is too ambitious. CC’s play can be discarded as far too conservative – you do not win at backgammon without taking risks. We should first make our ace-point, giving us a five-point home board, and then consider the rest of our game plan. Incidentally, 11/7, 6/1 is certainly better than 13/8, 5/1 because, as DD pointed out, it doesn’t duplicate our sixes.<br>
<br>
“The real question is whether we should bring more fire-power to bear on our 2-pt or start to escape our rear checkers. Long hours of study have taught me that the time to get the back checkers moving is when the opponent is on the bar. If QQ does anchor on our 2-pt we want those rear checkers on their way home and what better time to start them moving but now. Conversely if he doesn’t anchor we have sufficient firepower in the zone to attack his remaining blot. It is a question of balancing priorities, but I believe that 22/18, 61/ is the best play.”<br>
<br>
“Beautifully explained, EE. 22/18, 6/1 it is and Graves, one more Bloody Mary please.”<br>
